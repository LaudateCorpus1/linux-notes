To set permanently add either of the following options below Option	"RandRRotation"	"on" ;

NVIDIA BINARY ONLY OPTIONS

OPTIONAL; set screen orientation/locations (which is on left and on right) I believe these are standard xorg.conf options for all gpu's  and that it requires seperate device and screen sections in xorg.conf, this option is usually not needed but may be especially if plugging in say a HDMI screen after xorg is allready running. So in serverlayout add;

    Screen      1  "Screen1" RightOf "Screen0"

complete section looks like;

Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier     "Default Layout"
    Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
    Screen      1  "Screen1" RightOf "Screen0"
    Option    "Xinerama" "true"
EndSection

Next in the Device section for the screen you want rotated say Device1 add;

    Option          "Rotate" "left"

full section looks like;

Section "Device"
    Identifier     "Device1"
    Driver         "nvidia"
    VendorName     "NVIDIA Corporation"
    BoardName      "GeForce 6200 LE"
    BusID          "PCI:1:0:0"
    Screen          1
    Option          "Rotate" "left"
EndSection
