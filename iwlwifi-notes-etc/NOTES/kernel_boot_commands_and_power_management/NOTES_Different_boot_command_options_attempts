## I believe both "acpi_backlight=none acpi_osi="  where required to get keyboard and possibly screen backlight working (I DONT BELIEVE THIS WAS REQUIRED IN PREVIOUS KERNEL/UBUNTU VERSIONS"

acpi_osi=		# disable all strings
acpi_osi=!      # disable all built-in OS vendor strings      *will try this now

## Might try;
pci=nocrs		[X86] Ignore PCI host bridge windows from ACPI. If you need to use this, please report a bug.
pcie_aspm=	[PCIE] Forcibly enable or disable PCIe Active State Power Management.
        off	        Disable ASPM.
		force	    Enable ASPM even on devices that claim not to support it. WARNING: Forcing ASPM on may cause system lockups.		        

acpi.power_nocheck=1 OR                 Disable the check of power state. Option two modifies the list of supported OS interface strings (changes the 
acpi_osi=Linux                          OS compatibility reported to the BIOS). Necessary on some broken BIOSes to make temperature/fan control work.
