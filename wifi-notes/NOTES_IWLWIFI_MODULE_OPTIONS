Module command line options (To permenantly save add to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf and put "options iwlwifi $options" in either/both);

wd_disable=1        turn watchdog off with =1 on with =0
11n_disable=1       this option turns off with =1 and on with =0 802.11n support plus a view other things
11n_disable=8       this re-enables transmission antenna aggregation
bt_coex_active=0    turn on with =1 off with =0 bluetooth coexistence
swcrypto=1          turn on software decrypt with =1 turn on hardware decrypt with =0
power_level=1thru5  1 is normal i believe 5 in max power all the time

The iwlwifi driver in newer kernels also uses 'iwldvm' or 'iwlmvm' driver as a dependency. If it happens to be "iwlmvm" driver, it has a parameter called "power_scheme" that offers three power saving modes - 1: Always Active, 2: Balanced, 3: low-power. Default is '2' (balanced). I personally believe that the default 'balanced' mode is one of the major causes that keep turning power-management "on". A solution that I have tested successfully many times with this driver, is to set the "power_scheme" mode to '1' (Active). This can be applied permanently by creating a conf file in /etc/modprobe.d directory -


    sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/iwlmvm.conf <<< "options iwlmvm power_scheme=1"
