 SOME CARDS REQUIRE THAT THE KERNEL INTERFACE BE ACTIVATED BEFORE YOU CAN USE IW OR WIRELESS_TOOLS:

# ip link set wlp3s0 up

 SCAN FOR WIRELESS AP'S

# sudo iw wlp3s0 scan
		OR
# sudo iw wlp3s0 scan | less

 IF AD-HOC MODE SET OPERATING MODE TO IBSS (sum cards require interface to be down for changing modes "ip link set wlp3s0 down")

# iw wlp3s0 set type ibss

 No encryption

# iw wlp3s0 connect "your_essid"

 WEP

    	using a hexadecimal or ASCII key (the format is distinguished automatically, because a WEP key has a fixed length):

# iw wlp3s0 connect "your_essid" key 0:your_key

    	using a hexadecimal or ASCII key, specifying the third set up key as default (keys are counted from zero, four are possible):

# iw wlp3s0 connect "your_essid" key d:2:your_key

 WPA/WPA2 ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU GOT FROM #DISCOVER ACCESS POINTS, ISSUE THIS COMMAND:

# wpa_supplicant -i interface -c <(wpa_passphrase "your_SSID" "your_key")

 CHECK IF ASSOCIATED

# iw wlp3s0 link

 HERE IS A COMPLETE EXAMPLE OF SETTING UP A WIRELESS NETWORK WITH WPA SUPPLICANT AND DHCP. 

# ip link set dev wlp3s0 up
# wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
# dhclient wlp3s0

 AND THEN TO CLOSE THE CONNECTION, YOU CAN SIMPLY DISABLE THE INTERFACE:

# ip link set dev wlp3s0 down

 FOR A STATIC IP, YOU WOULD REPLACE THE DHCPCD INVOCATION WITH

# ip addr add 192.168.0.10/24 broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev wlp3s0
# ip route add default via 192.168.0.1

 AND BEFORE DISABLING THE INTERFACE YOU WOULD FIRST FLUSH THE IP ADDRESS AND GATEWAY:

# ip addr flush dev wlp3s0
# ip route flush dev wlp3s0
