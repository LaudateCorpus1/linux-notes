Accessing graphical applications inside the chroot

You can run graphical applications within a chroot, but you need to provide an X server for them to run in first. The easiest way to do this is to set the display of the chroot system to be identical to the root display of your system's main X server and provide access to it.

In other words, in the chroot shell type;

export DISPLAY=:0.0

And in the system shell type

xhost +

You don't have to enter the chroot shell to access its commands,
just type;

gksudo chroot /var/chroot firefox -DISPLAY=:0.0

If you want the chroot to have its own display, you need to create this display with the Xnest command. Perform the following instructions outside the chroot:

    Install the xhost and xnest packages.

    Ensure that /proc is mounted and DNS resolution is set-up within the chroot (see above).
    Type the following into a Terminal:

        Xnest -ac :1

    A blank Xnest window should appear.
    Open another Terminal and type the following to enter the chroot:

        sudo chroot /var/chroot

    While in the chroot shell, type the following:

        export DISPLAY=localhost:1

        If you have problems starting graphical applications, type the above command again, but replace localhost with 127.0.0.1 

    Start a window manager inside the chroot. For example, install the metacity package and type:

        metacity &

    Start a graphical application inside the chroot (making sure that you installed it in the chroot first). It should appear in the Xnest window.
