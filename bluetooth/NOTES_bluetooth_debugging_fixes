to be greeted by its internal command prompt. Then enter:

# power on
# agent on
# default-agent
# scan on
    [NEW] Device 00:1D:43:6D:03:26 Lasmex LBT10
# pair 00:1D:43:6D:03:26
# connect 00:1D:43:6D:03:26

    IF
        bluetoothd[487]: Authentication attempt without agent
        bluetoothd[487]: Access denied: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
    THEN
[bluetooth]# trust 00:1D:43:6D:03:26

    IF Pairing fails with AuthenticationFailed TRY;
# hciconfig hci0 sspmode 0

    IF Pairing works, but connecting does not TRY;
[bluetooth]# connect 00:1D:43:6D:03:26
Attempting to connect to 00:1D:43:6D:03:26
Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed

    To further investigate, have a look at the log via one of the following commands:
# systemctl status bluetooth
# journalctl -n 20
    LOOK FOR Protocol not available

    If restarting PulseAudio does not work, you need to load module-bluetooth-discover.
# pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover

    USING PASSKEY
$ passkey-agent --default <pin>
