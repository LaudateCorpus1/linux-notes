PowerTop "Good" Power Savings

Use Intel's powertop to put the following devices into a "Good" power saving state:

    Webcam
    Audio
    DRAM
    Ethernet
    Wifi
    Bluetooth
    SATA link
    MMC/SD 

Note that the recent changes to pm-utils in Ubuntu Precise 12.04 LTS now include these powertop recommendations when running on battery power.
