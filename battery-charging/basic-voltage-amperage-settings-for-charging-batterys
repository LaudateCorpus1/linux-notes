Requirement for attempting to recharge a nonrecharable battery.
Basically you would need a regulate source, voltage regulated to approx 10 to 20 percent greater than the battery no load voltage that decreases as the battery reaches no load voltage. The current must also be limited, normally 1/10th of stated amp hours (in this case milliamps. You could also apply a greater voltage, when it gets hot remove voltage be for it explodes - Just kidding.
