(.bin files are for flashing from a stock firmware. .trx files are for flashing from OpenWrt. To convert from .bin to .trx, strip the 32-byte header from the .bin file:)

dd if=openwrt-10.03.1-brcm47xx-wrt150n-squashfs.bin bs=32 skip=1 of=openwrt-10.03.1-brcm47xx-wrt150n-squashfs.trx

(IMPORTANT: Verify that the output file is only 32 bytes smaller than the input file and that the .trx file begins with HDR0: )
