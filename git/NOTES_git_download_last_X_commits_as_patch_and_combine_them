export commits into patches with this command:

	git format-patch -x

where -x means how many commits back from the current head and it has to be integer.

For example if i want to generate patch for 10 last commits:

	git format-patch -10

The above example will generate 10 file patches, this will cause a problem for the team leader, because he need to apply the patches one by one. You can squashed those patches into 1 single file patch. See the code below:

	git format-patch -x --stdout > patch-ddmmyyy.patch

From the format above it means all those generated patches will compress into 1 output file. And for the standard i usually add the date for the file, so i know when i generate it.

Note: The generated patches also work with subversion (svn).
