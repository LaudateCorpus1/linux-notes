eventually ?mates power deamon/indicator panel? realizes AC power has been removed
and changes backlight settings acordingly.Unfortunatly no power change uevent.

heres the only call on power change if backlight settings are different between
battery and AC

KERNEL[3398.267547] change   /devices/platform/soc@0/ac0000.geniqup/a88000.i2c/i2c-10/10-002c/backlight/sn65dsi86 (backlight)
UDEV  [3398.274679] change   /devices/platform/soc@0/ac0000.geniqup/a88000.i2c/i2c-10/10-002c/backlight/sn65dsi86 (backlight)

And the two kicks to the head are it doesnt say if changed up/down for dirty work around
and it also obviously sends these events whenever bcklight is changed from any program/reason
