at start of driver will be a data section "struct driver_name data" "struct drivername" with int lines etc
need to add something like
struct some_battery {
	int last_state;
}

then in poling section something like

	int state;
	state = some_battery_read(battery, ADPT);
	            or not sure how next line would get state
	battery->adapter_online = !!(val & BIT(7));

		if (state != battery->last_state) {
            power_supply_changed(psy);
			battery->last_state = state;
			}
