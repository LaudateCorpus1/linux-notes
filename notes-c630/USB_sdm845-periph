	 * The hardware design intends this port to be hooked up in peripheral
	 * mode, so we'll hardcode it here.  Some details:
	 * - SDM845 expects only a single Type C connector so it has only one
	 *   native Type C port but cheza has two Type C connectors.
	 * - The only source of DP is the single native Type C port.
	 * - On cheza we want to be able to hook DP up to _either_ of the
	 *   two Type C connectors and want to be able to achieve 4 lanes of DP.
	 * - When you configure a Type C port for 4 lanes of DP you lose USB3.
	 * - In order to make everything work, the native Type C port is always
	 *   configured as 4-lanes DP so it's always available.
	 * - The extra USB3 port on SDM845 goes to a USB 3 hub which is then
	 *   sent to the two Type C connectors.
	 * - The extra USB2 lines from the native Type C port are always
	 *   setup as "peripheral" so that we can mux them over to one connector
	 *   or the other if someone needs the connector configured as a gadget
	 *   (but they only get USB2 speeds).
	 *
	 * All the hardware muxes would allow us to hook things up in different
	 * ways to some potential benefit for static configurations (you could
	 * achieve extra USB2 bandwidth by using two different ports for the
	 * two connectors or possibly even get USB3 peripheral mode), but in
	 * each case you end up forcing to disconnect/reconnect an in-use
	 * USB session in some cases depending on what you hotplug into the
	 * other connector.  Thus hardcoding this as peripheral makes sense.
