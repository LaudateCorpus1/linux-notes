First install the module:

sudo apt-get install sshfs

Load it to kernel

sudo modprobe fuse

Setting permissions

sudo adduser $USER fuse

sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse

sudo chmod +x /dev/fusermount

Now weâ€™ll create a directory to mount the remote folder in.

I chose to create it in my home directory and call it remoteDir.

mkdir ~/remoteDir

Now I ran the command to mount it(mount on home).

sshfs maythux@192.168.xx.xx:/home/maythuxServ/Mounted ~/remoteDir

Now it should be mounted

cd ~/remoteDir
ls -l
