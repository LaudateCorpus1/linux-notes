SETUP (NO HDA_ANALYZER REQUIRED!!!)

0x18  DEVICE;Speaker  CHANNEL;Center/LFE CHANNEL_GROUP; 15
0x19  DEVICE;Speaker  CHANNEL;Center/LFE CHANNEL_GROUP; 15
0x1a  DEVICE;Speaker  CHANNEL;Center/LFE CHANNEL_GROUP; 15

0x1e  DEVICE;Speaker  CHANNEL;Center/LFE CHANNEL_GROUP; 15

Explanation; Sub works on both "stereo output" and "2.1 output" modes. The stereo option must sounds much better either sum hardware/software is sending mostly LF to external sub providing 2.1 in 2.0 mode, or it sounds better cuz everything is being sent to it. in 2.1 the sub is much much more less obvious and sounds better if you set the volume for the sub higher then left/right.

Gnome alsa mixer shows "Bass Spe" as a volume where as last boot (without working sub) showed something with the word surround. 

TODO: 
1: Check hda_analyzer and make sure all volumes are enabled turned up etc. save diff python script if so and run at boot.
2: Remove each option in hdajackretask to make sure no unneeded changes are being made.
