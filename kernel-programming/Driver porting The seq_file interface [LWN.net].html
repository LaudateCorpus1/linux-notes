There are numerous ways for a device driver (or other kernel component) to
provide information to the user or system administrator.  One very useful
technique is the creation of virtual files, in /proc or
elsewhere.  Virtual files can provide human-readable output that is easy to
get at without any special utility programs; they can also make life easier
for script writers.  It is not surprising that the use of virtual files has
grown over the years.

There are numerous ways for a device driver (or other kernel component) to
provide information to the user or system administrator.  One very useful
technique is the creation of virtual files, in <tt>/proc</tt> or
elsewhere.  Virtual files can provide human-readable output that is easy to
get at without any special utility programs; they can also make life easier
for script writers.  It is not surprising that the use of virtual files has
grown over the years.
<p>
Creating those files correctly has always been a bit of a challenge,
however.  It is not that hard to make a <tt>/proc</tt> file which returns a
string.  But life gets trickier if the output is long - anything greater
than an application is likely to read in a single operation.  Handling
multiple reads (and seeks) requires careful attention to the reader's
position within the virtual file - that position is, likely as not, in the
middle of a line of output.  The Linux kernel is full of <tt>/proc</tt>
file implementations that get this wrong.
</p><p>
The 2.6 kernel contains a set of functions (implemented by Alexander Viro)
which are designed to make it easy for virtual file creators to get it
right.  This interface (called "seq_file") is not strictly a 2.6 feature -
it was also merged into 2.4.15.  But 2.6 is where the feature is starting
to see serious use, so it is worth describing here.
</p><p>
The seq_file interface is available via
<tt>&lt;linux/seq_file.h&gt;</tt>.  There are three aspects to seq_file:
</p><ul>
<li> An iterator interface which lets a virtual file implementation step 
     through the objects it is presenting.
<p>
</p></li><li> Some utility functions for formatting objects for output 
     without needing to worry about things like output buffers.
<p>
</p></li><li> A set of canned <tt>file_operations</tt> which implement most
     operations on the virtual file.
</li></ul>
<p>
We'll look at the seq_file interface via an extremely simple example: a
loadable module which creates a file called <tt>/proc/sequence</tt>.  The
file, when read, simply produces a set of increasing integer values, one
per line.  The sequence will continue until the user loses patience and
finds something better to do.  The file is seekable, in that one can do
something like the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    dd if=/proc/sequence of=out1 count=1
    dd if=/proc/sequence skip=1 out=out2 count=1
</pre>
<p>
Then concatenate the output files <tt>out1</tt> and <tt>out2</tt> and get
the right result.  Yes, it is a thoroughly useless module, but the point is
to show how the mechanism works without getting lost in other details.
(Those wanting to see the full source for this module can find it <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/22359/">here</a>). 

</p><h2>The iterator interface</h2>

Modules implementing a virtual file with seq_file must implement a simple
iterator object that allows stepping through the data of interest.
Iterators must be able to move to a specific position - like the file they
implement - but the interpretation of that position is up to the iterator
itself.  A seq_file implementation that is formatting firewall rules, for
example, could interpret position <i>N</i> as the <i>N</i>th rule in the
chain.  Positioning can thus be done in whatever way makes the most sense
for the generator of the data, which need not be aware of how a position
translates to an offset in the virtual file.  The one obvious exception is
that a position of zero should indicate the beginning of the file.
<p>
The <tt>/proc/sequence</tt> iterator just uses the count of the next number
it will output as its position.
</p><p>
Four functions must be implemented to make the iterator work.  The first,
called <tt>start()</tt> takes a position as an argument and returns an iterator
which will start reading at that position.  For our simple sequence
example, the <tt>start()</tt> function looks like:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static void *ct_seq_start(struct seq_file *s, loff_t *pos)
{
	loff_t *spos = kmalloc(sizeof(loff_t), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (! spos)
		return NULL;
	*spos = *pos;
	return spos;
}
</pre>
<p>
The entire data structure for this iterator is a single <tt>loff_t</tt>
value holding the current position.  There is no upper bound for the
sequence iterator, but that will not be the case for most other seq_file
implementations; in most cases the <tt>start()</tt> function should check
for a "past end of file" condition and return <tt>NULL</tt> if need be.
</p><p>
For more complicated applications, the <tt>private</tt> field of the
<tt>seq_file</tt> structure can be used.  There is also a special value
whch can be returned by the <tt>start()</tt> function called
<tt>SEQ_START_TOKEN</tt>; it can be used if you wish to instruct your
<tt>show()</tt> function (described below) to print a header at the top of
the output.  <tt>SEQ_START_TOKEN</tt> should only be used if the offset is
zero, however.
</p><p>
The next function to implement is called, amazingly, <tt>next()</tt>; its
job is to move the iterator forward to the next position in the sequence.
The example module can simply increment the position by one; more useful
modules will do what is needed to step through some data structure.  The
<tt>next()</tt> function returns a new iterator, or <tt>NULL</tt> if the
sequence is complete.  Here's the example version:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static void *ct_seq_next(struct seq_file *s, void *v, loff_t *pos)
{
	loff_t *spos = (loff_t *) v;
	*pos = ++(*spos);
	return spos;
}
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>stop()</tt> function is called when iteration is complete; its job,
of course, is to clean up.  If dynamic memory is allocated for the
iterator, <tt>stop()</tt> is the place to return it.
</p><p>
</p><pre>static void ct_seq_stop(struct seq_file *s, void *v)
{
	kfree (v);
}
</pre>
<p>
Finally, the <tt>show()</tt> function should format the object currently
pointed to by the iterator for output.  It should return zero, or an error
code if something goes wrong.  The example module's <tt>show()</tt>
function is:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static int ct_seq_show(struct seq_file *s, void *v)
{
	loff_t *spos = (loff_t *) v;
	seq_printf(s, "%Ld\n", *spos);
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
We will look at <tt>seq_printf()</tt> in a moment.  But first, the
definition of the seq_file iterator is finished by creating a
<tt>seq_operations</tt> structure with the four functions we have just
defined:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static struct seq_operations ct_seq_ops = {
	.start = ct_seq_start,
	.next  = ct_seq_next,
	.stop  = ct_seq_stop,
	.show  = ct_seq_show
};
</pre>
<p>
This structure will be needed to tie our iterator to the <tt>/proc</tt>
file in a little bit.
</p><p>
It's worth noting that the interator value returned by <tt>start()</tt> and
manipulated by the other functions is considered to be completely opaque by
the seq_file code.  It can thus be anything that is useful in stepping
through the data to be output.  Counters can be useful, but it could also
be a direct pointer into an array or linked list.  Anything goes, as long
as the programmer is aware that things can happen between calls to the
iterator function.  However, the seq_file code (by design) will not sleep
between 
the calls to <tt>start()</tt> and <tt>stop()</tt>, so holding a lock during
that time is a reasonable thing to do.  The seq_file code will also avoid
taking any other locks while the iterator is
active. 


</p><h2>Formatted output</h2>

The seq_file code manages positioning within the output created by the
iterator and getting it into the user's buffer.  But, for that to work,
that output must be passed to the seq_file code.  Some utility functions
have been defined which make this task easy.
<p>
Most code will simply use <tt>seq_printf()</tt>, which works pretty much
like <tt>printk()</tt>, but which requires the <tt>seq_file</tt> pointer as
an argument.  It is common to ignore the return value from
<tt>seq_printf()</tt>, but a function producing complicated output may want
to check that value and quit if something non-zero is returned; an error
return means that the seq_file buffer has been filled and further output
will be discarded.
</p><p>
For straight character output, the following functions may be used:
</p><p>
</p><pre>int seq_putc(struct seq_file *m, char c);
int seq_puts(struct seq_file *m, const char *s);
int seq_escape(struct seq_file *m, const char *s, const char *esc);
</pre>
<p>
The first two output a single character and a string, just like one would
expect.  <tt>seq_escape()</tt> is like <tt>seq_puts()</tt>, except that any
character in <tt>s</tt> which is in the string <tt>esc</tt> will be
represented in octal form in the output.
</p><p>
There is also a function for printing filenames:
</p><p>
</p><pre>int seq_path(struct seq_file *m, struct vfsmount *mnt, 
	     struct dentry *dentry, char *esc);
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>mnt</tt> and <tt>dentry</tt> indicate the file of interest, and
<tt>esc</tt> is a set of characters which should be escaped in the output.
This function is more suited to filesystem code than device drivers, however.

</p><p>

</p><h2>Making it all work</h2>

So far, we have a nice set of functions which can produce output within the
seq_file system, but we have not yet turned them into a file that a user
can see.  Creating a file within the kernel requires, of course, the
creation of a set of <tt>file_operations</tt> which implement the
operations on that file.  The seq_file interface provides a set of canned
operations which do most of the work.  The virtual file author still must
implement the <tt>open()</tt> method, however, to hook everything up.  The
open function is often a single line, as in the example module:
<p>
</p><pre>static int ct_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
	return seq_open(file, &amp;ct_seq_ops);
};
</pre>
<p>
Here, the call to <tt>seq_open()</tt> takes the <tt>seq_operations</tt>
structure we created before, and gets set up to iterate through the virtual
file.  
</p><p>
On a successful open, <tt>seq_open()</tt> stores the <tt>struct
seq_file</tt> pointer in <tt>file-&gt;private_data</tt>.  If you have an
application where the same iterator can be used for more than one file, you
can store an arbitrary pointer in the <tt>private</tt> field of the
<tt>seq_file</tt> structure; that value can then be retrieved by the
iterator functions.  
</p><p>

The other operations of interest - <tt>read()</tt>,
<tt>llseek()</tt>, and <tt>release()</tt> - are all implemented by the
seq_file code itself.  So a virtual file's <tt>file_operations</tt>
structure will look like:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static struct file_operations ct_file_ops = {
	.owner   = THIS_MODULE,
	.open    = ct_open,
	.read    = seq_read,
	.llseek  = seq_lseek,
	.release = seq_release
};
</pre>
<p>
The final step is the creation of the <tt>/proc</tt> file itself.  In the
example code, that is done in the initialization code in the usual way:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static int ct_init(void)
{
	struct proc_dir_entry *entry;

	entry = create_proc_entry("sequence", 0, NULL);
	if (entry)
		entry-&gt;proc_fops = &amp;ct_file_ops;
	return 0;
}

module_init(ct_init);
</pre>
<p>
And that is pretty much it.

</p><h2>The extra-simple version</h2>

For extremely simple virtual files, there is an even easier interface.  A
module can define only the <tt>show()</tt> function, which should create
all the output that the virtual file will contain.  The file's
<tt>open()</tt> method then calls:
<p>
</p><pre>int single_open(struct file *file, 
                int (*show)(struct seq_file *m, void *p), 
		void *data);
</pre>
<p>
When output time comes, the <tt>show()</tt> function will be called once.
The <tt>data</tt> value given to <tt>single_open()</tt> can be found in the
<tt>private</tt> field of the <tt>seq_file</tt> structure.  When using
<tt>single_open()</tt>, the programmer should use <tt>single_release()</tt>
instead of <tt>seq_release()</tt> in the <tt>file_operations</tt> structure
to avoid a memory leak.<br clear="all"></p><hr width="60%" align="left">

    </p>
    After using this article as an example to port the 
/proc/net/ip_conntrack interface over to seq_file, and about 5 hours of 
crashing/rebooting/debugging, I have to admit that there are some 
shortcomings in it.<p>Some hints for other people, so they don't fall into the same pits as I did:</p><p>1)
 If you allocate something in ct_seq_start(), the place to free it is 
_NOT_ in ct_seq_stop().  This is because ct_seq_stop() is even called if
 ct_seq_start() returns an error (Like ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)). You would then
 end up calling kfree(ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM)) which your mm subsystem doesn't 
really like. I am now kfree()ing in ct_seq_next(), just before it 
returns with NULL at the end of the table.</p><p>2) If you take a lock 
in ct_seq_start(), do it unconditionally as the first thing.  Even if 
ct_seq_start() fails, ct_seq_stop() is called.  In ct_seq_stop() you 
have no idea of knowing if ct_seq_start() failed or not  - so you will 
unconditionally unlock.<br>

    <i>I am now kfree()ing in ct_seq_next(), just before it returns with NULL at the end of the table</i>
<p>
Seems like that would be a problem if the user chooses not to read all the way to EOF.
</p><p>
This just sounds like a basic bug in the seq_file interface.  If 
ct_seq_start() fails, it should be ct_seq_start's responsibility to not 
change any state, and thus ct_seq_stop doesn't need to be, and should 
not be, called.  After all, does a POSIX program call close(-1) when 
open() fails?

    </p>
    Users should be clear about the difference between a position and an            
iterator (this confused me for a while). The position is your means of            
communication with the seq_file interface, telling it where you are, and            
for it to tell you where to go.             
            
<p>The iterator is an opaque value, about which seq_file understands 
nothing,            
except that you return it from your <code>start</code> and            
<code>next</code> handlers, and it will give it back to you in            
<code>next</code>, <code>stop</code> and <code>show</code>.            
            
</p><p>Examples of iterators given in the article are a simple index (using            
the pointer as an integer, i.e. it doesn't really point to anything), or            
a pointer to a linked list entry or an array member. However, if you have            
to navigate some more complex structure, such as              
a hash table, it can be useful to have a struct which holds several              
values, for example:              
              
</p><ul><pre>struct my_pos {              
	my_hash_table *table;              
	int hash;              
	my_ht_entry *entry;              
}              
</pre></ul>           
              
This allows a single value (your iterator, <code>void *v</code>) to tell         
you everything you              
need to know in order to walk the hashtable. In this case, as in the         
<code>/proc/sequence</code> example, <code>v</code>              
remains the same throughout the walk.              
              
<p>On the other hand, the position, <code>loff_t *pos</code>, is a         
strange beast. If you start reading the <code>/proc</code> file from the              
beginning, then <code>start</code> will be called with position 0, 1, 2,              
etc. until it returns NULL. At this point the user gets EOF, and they can              
then seek around and start reading again, which results in your              
<code>start</code> handler being called again.              
              
</p><p>However, if the user skips more than the length of the file, (e.g.              
<code>dd if=/proc/my_file bs=1G skip=1</code>, then your code will be              
called with position 0 twice! The user doesn't get what they were              
expecting (an empty file), but the whole file, as if the seek never              
happened. <code>strace</code> shows that the seek appears to succeed. I              
think this behavious is wrong and constitutes a mental health hazard.              
              
</p><p>If you want to use the same set of operations for multiple files in              
/proc, you need a way for them to distinguish what object they operate              
on. The article mentions <code>s-&gt;private</code>, but you can only use    
this after you have called seq_open, because the seq_file object doesn't    
exist before that.               
              
On the 2.6 kernel, it appears that a good place to store this private              
data is in the <code>struct inode *inode</code> which is passed to your              
<code>open</code> handler:              
              
</p><ul><pre>static int my_open (struct inode *inode, struct file          
*file)</pre></ul>          
              
In particular, 2.6 has a function called <code>PROC_I</code> which    
converts your <code>struct inode</code> into a <code>struct              
proc_inode</code>, which has a member called <code>pde</code>, which is              
your <code>struct proc_dir_entry</code>.               
              
<p>So you can create the <code>proc_dir_entry</code>, initialise its              
<code>data</code> member with a pointer to your private data, and then in              
the <code>open</code> handler you can get to it from        
<code>inode-&gt;pde</code>. For example:              
              
</p><ul><pre>// module init              
static int __init init()              
{              
	my_proc_entry = create_proc_entry(filename, 0, NULL);              
	/* ... check for failure ... */              
	my_proc_entry-&gt;data = my_data;              
}              
              
static int my_open (struct inode *inode, struct file *file)              
{              
	struct seq_file *s;       
	result = seq_open(file, &amp;seq_ops);       
	/* ... check for failure ... */       
	/* file-&gt;private_data was initialised by seq_open */       
	s = (struct seq_file *)file-&gt;private_data;       
	my_data = PROC_I(inode)-&gt;pde-&gt;data;              
	s-&gt;private = my_data;              
}              
              
static int my_seq_start (...) {              
	my_data = s-&gt;private;              
}              
</pre></ul>          
              
I'm still looking for a good way to do this on 2.4, which lacks   
<code>PROC_I</code> and <code>struct proc_inode</code>. Can anyone help?

    This article describes how to generate an infinite series of 
integers. It would have been much more practical if this article had 
talked about generating finite series of integers ... I had trouble 
getting the seq_file iterator to stop calling my functions. <br>
<p>
I read this article and <a href="http://www.kernelnewbies.org/documents/seq_file_howto.txt">http://www.kernelnewbies.org/documents/seq_file_howto.txt</a>. Nevertheless, I still wasted a lot of time trying to get it to work. <br>
</p><p>
My notes:<br>
</p><p>
you write the routines your_start, your_stop, your_next, and your_show<br>
</p><p>
The pos parameter to your_start and your_next is an index into the set 
of items that you wish to enumerate. your_next must increment this 
index, as in ++*pos. <br>
</p><p>
your_start must know the number of items in your set so that it can 
check the validity of *pos. your_start will be called again, even after 
your_next returns NULL and your_stop has been called. <br>
</p><p>
Let's say that you want to count from 0 through 9. your_start is called 
with *pos==0. It returns a pointer to your iterator data structure. 
your_show is called, then your_next is called. This happens until 
your_next returns NULL or ERR_PTR(some-negative-error-code). your_stop 
is then called. At this point, your_start will be called *again*, with 
*pos==10 ... seems strange to me, but that is the behavior. <br>
</p><p>
The iterator pointer returned by your_start/your_next can be whatever 
you want, including integer values. However, be advised that the values 
in the range -1000 &lt;= n &lt;= 0 are interpreted as error 
conditions/NULL. Therefore, you probably want to return a pointer. <br>
</p><p>
The kernelnewbies.org seq_file_howto.txt document says your_start should
 return error codes like EACCES if the *pos position is out of bounds. 
Note that if you want to do this, then you must return -EACCES, not 
EACCES. Maybe that was obvious to experienced kernel hackers, but it 
certainly was not obvious to me. Do this by returning ERR_PTR(-EACCES). 
If this value is not negative, then the seq_file code will assume that 
you have returned a valid iterator pointer and it will call your_show. <br>
</p><p>
It is probably easier to simply return NULL on error conditions (like 
*pos out of bounds) and not worry about it. When I tried to worry about 
it and do the right thing, it just caused trouble for me. <br>
</p><p>
I spent some time looking at the seq_file code. Frankly, I was quite 
disappointed ... the implementation looked pretty ugly to me. <br>

Just wanted to say thanks for the comment. You've probably saved me a good few minutes trying
to work out why seq_file kept calling my code.

It must be said, the seq_file interface is one of the uglier APIs I've seen in the kernel.
Clear and easy to use it is not.

Hi all<br>
<p>
is it normal to have more than one stop while reading a seq file ?<br>
</p><p>
actually I have a list with 37 items but I get a "spontaneous" stop 
while processing element nine, and than a new start with the element ten
 (*pos=10).<br>
</p><p>
after some hours (ok, two day :D) of debugging, it's all working now.. 
but it was really difficult for me to understand seq_file interface :D<br>
</p><p>
    thanks<br>

I think it calls stop at the end of every page (4 KB), followed by the start.<br>
At the end of file it calls stop, then start, followed by one more stop.<br>
So it works like this:<br>
.start<br>
.stop<br>
---PAGE---<br>
.start<br>
.stop<br>
---PAGE---<br>
...<br>
.stop<br>
.start<br>
.stop<br>
---EOF---<br>
Special case is when the file is empty. Then there are just two calls (not 4): one .start one .stop.<br>

...<br>
.stop(A)<br>
.start<br>
.stop(B)<br>
---EOF---<br>
There is a problem to differ the .stop(A) from .stop(B) when you have to
 return some resource (e.g. semaphore), that has been taken in .start, 
back at the end of sequence. The position counter is equal in both (A) 
and (B), because you are at EOF.<br>

If I want to disable interrupts (call local_irq_save/local_irq_restore)
