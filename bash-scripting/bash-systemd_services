systemctl is-active --quiet service && echo Service is running
    will exit with status zero if service is active, non-zero otherwise, making it ideal for scripts:
    If you omit --quiet it will also output the current status to its standard output.


    see if sshd is running if so restart it
systemctl is-active --quiet sshd.service && systemctl restart sshd.service

    This will check if the service is down and perform service restart
systemctl is-active --quiet <service name> || <service name> restart
    the || there checks if the return value from systemctl is non-zero meaning if it's not active as explained by the author.

    non systemd OS's
    Example:
ps -C privoxy && echo running
    The quiet version:
ps -C privoxy 1>/dev/null && echo running
    Caveat:
    I noticed that service-names longer than 14 characters can give a false positive.
