Property Details
The “allow-bold” property

  “allow-bold”               gboolean

Controls whether or not the terminal will attempt to draw bold text. This may happen either by using a bold font variant, or by repainting text with a different offset.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: TRUE
The “audible-bell” property

  “audible-bell”             gboolean

Controls whether or not the terminal will beep when the child outputs the "bl" sequence.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: TRUE
The “backspace-binding” property

  “backspace-binding”        VteEraseBinding

Controls what string or control sequence the terminal sends to its child when the user presses the backspace key.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: VTE_ERASE_AUTO
The “cjk-ambiguous-width” property

  “cjk-ambiguous-width”      gint

This setting controls whether ambiguous-width characters are narrow or wide when using the UTF-8 encoding (vte_terminal_set_encoding()). In all other encodings, the width of ambiguous-width characters is fixed.

This setting only takes effect the next time the terminal is reset, either via escape sequence or with vte_terminal_reset().

Flags: Read / Write

Allowed values: [1,2]

Default value: 1
The “current-directory-uri” property

  “current-directory-uri”    gchar *

The current directory URI, or NULL if unset.

Flags: Read

Default value: NULL
The “current-file-uri” property

  “current-file-uri”         gchar *

The current file URI, or NULL if unset.

Flags: Read

Default value: NULL
The “cursor-blink-mode” property

  “cursor-blink-mode”        VteCursorBlinkMode

Sets whether or not the cursor will blink. Using VTE_CURSOR_BLINK_SYSTEM will use the “gtk-cursor-blink” setting.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: VTE_CURSOR_BLINK_SYSTEM
The “cursor-shape” property

  “cursor-shape”             VteCursorShape

Controls the shape of the cursor.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: VTE_CURSOR_SHAPE_BLOCK
The “delete-binding” property

  “delete-binding”           VteEraseBinding

Controls what string or control sequence the terminal sends to its child when the user presses the delete key.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: VTE_ERASE_AUTO
The “encoding” property

  “encoding”                 gchar *

Controls the encoding the terminal will expect data from the child to be encoded with. For certain terminal types, applications executing in the terminal can change the encoding. The default is defined by the application's locale settings.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: NULL
The “font-desc” property

  “font-desc”                PangoFontDescription *

Specifies the font used for rendering all text displayed by the terminal, overriding any fonts set using gtk_widget_modify_font(). The terminal will immediately attempt to load the desired font, retrieve its metrics, and attempt to resize itself to keep the same number of rows and columns.

Flags: Read / Write
The “font-scale” property

  “font-scale”               gdouble

The terminal's font scale.

Flags: Read / Write

Allowed values: [0.25,4]

Default value: 1
The “icon-title” property

  “icon-title”               gchar *

The terminal's so-called icon title, or NULL if no icon title has been set.

Flags: Read

Default value: NULL
The “input-enabled” property

  “input-enabled”            gboolean

Controls whether the terminal allows user input. When user input is disabled, key press and mouse button press and motion events are not sent to the terminal's child.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: TRUE
The “pointer-autohide” property

  “pointer-autohide”         gboolean

Controls the value of the terminal's mouse autohide setting. When autohiding is enabled, the mouse cursor will be hidden when the user presses a key and shown when the user moves the mouse.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: FALSE
The “pty” property

  “pty”                      VtePty *

The PTY object for the terminal.

Flags: Read / Write
The “rewrap-on-resize” property

  “rewrap-on-resize”         gboolean

Controls whether or not the terminal will rewrap its contents, including the scrollback buffer, whenever the terminal's width changes.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: TRUE
The “scroll-on-keystroke” property

  “scroll-on-keystroke”      gboolean

Controls whether or not the terminal will forcibly scroll to the bottom of the viewable history when the user presses a key. Modifier keys do not trigger this behavior.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: FALSE
The “scroll-on-output” property

  “scroll-on-output”         gboolean

Controls whether or not the terminal will forcibly scroll to the bottom of the viewable history when the new data is received from the child.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: TRUE
The “scrollback-lines” property

  “scrollback-lines”         guint

The length of the scrollback buffer used by the terminal. The size of the scrollback buffer will be set to the larger of this value and the number of visible rows the widget can display, so 0 can safely be used to disable scrollback. Note that this setting only affects the normal screen buffer. For terminal types which have an alternate screen buffer, no scrollback is allowed on the alternate screen buffer.

Flags: Read / Write

Default value: 512
The “window-title” property

  “window-title”             gchar *

The terminal's title.

Flags: Read

Default value: NULL
The “word-char-exceptions” property

  “word-char-exceptions”     gchar *

The set of characters which will be considered parts of a word when doing word-wise selection, in addition to the default which only considers alphanumeric characters part of a word.

If NULL, a built-in set is used.

Flags: Read

Default value: NULL

Since: 0.40
