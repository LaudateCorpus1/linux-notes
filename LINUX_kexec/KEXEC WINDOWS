BOOT WINDOWS WITH KEXEC

Suppose Windows is installed in the first partition of the first disk (hd0,0), how can I boot into it directly using kexec in Linux?

# kexec -l grub.exe --command-line "root(hd0,0); chainloader (hd0,0)+1; boot"
# kexec -e

DIDNT WORK

BUT THIS DID!!!

kexec -l grub.exe --command-line=&#34;--config-file=chainloader &#40;hd0,0&#41;+1;rootnoverify &#40;hd0&#41;;boot&#34;

kexec -e
