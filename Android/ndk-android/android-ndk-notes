# Create an arm64 API 26 libc++ toolchain.
$NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py \
  --arch arm64 \
  --api 26 \
  --stl=libc++ \
  --install-dir=my-toolchain

Here's how you'd set up your environment to use it to build a traditional open source project:

# Add the standalone toolchain to the search path.
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/toolchains/android-sdk-r16b

# Tell configure what tools to use.
target_host=arm-linux-androideabi
export AR=$target_host-ar
export AS=$target_host-as
export CC=$target_host-gcc
export CXX=$target_host-g++
export LD=$target_host-ld
export STRIP=$target_host-strip

# Tell configure what flags Android requires.
export CFLAGS="-fPIE -fPIC"
export LDFLAGS="-pie"

As an example, here's how to build toybox after performing the previous steps:

git clone https://github.com/landley/toybox.git
cd toybox
make defconfig && make





C++ STL support

The standalone toolchain includes a copy of a C++ Standard Template Library implementation. This implementation is either for GNU libstdc++, STLport, or libc++, depending on what you specify for the --stl=<name> option described previously. To use this implementation of STL, you need to link your project with the proper library:

    Use -static-libstdc++ when using libc++ for the static library version, or -lstdc++ (implicit) to link against the static library version of any other implementation. Doing so ensures that all required C++ STL code is included into your final binary. This method is ideal if you are only generating a single shared library or executable.

This is the method that we recommend.

    Alternatively, use -lgnustl_shared to link against the shared library version of GNU libstdc++. If you use this option, you must also make sure to package libgnustl_shared.so with your app in order for your code to load properly. Table 2 shows where this file is for each toolchain type.
