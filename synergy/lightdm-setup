Autostart Synergy before logging in (LightDM)

On the client

Add the following line at the end of /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:

[SeatDefaults]
greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/synergyc <OPTIONS> <SERVER HOSTNAME>

Where <SERVER HOSTNAME> is the name/IP of the server you are connecting to.

On the server

Add the following line at the end of /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf:

display-setup-script=/usr/bin/synergys -c <CONFIG FILE>

Where <CONFIG FILE> is the path to your config file for synergy (see above for typical locations).

On the Ubuntu 14.04 64bit the configuration file changed to /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf, and you need add this line at the end of the file:

greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/synergys -c <CONFIG FILE>

On the Ubuntu 14.10 64bit add the line above to /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf.
