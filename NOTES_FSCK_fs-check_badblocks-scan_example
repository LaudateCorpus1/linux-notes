Run a ext4 file system check and badblocks scan with progress info

Nothing fancy, just a regular filesystem scan that calls the badblocks program and shows some progress info. The used options are:

-c ? check for bad sectors with badblocks program

-D ? optimize directories if possible

-f ? force check, even if filesystem seems clean

-t ? print timing stats (use -tt for more)

-y ? assume answer ?yes? to all questions

-C 0 ? print progress info to stdout

/dev/sdxx ? the partition to check, (e.g. /dev/sda1 for first partition on first hard disk)

NOTE: Never run fsck on a mounted partition!
