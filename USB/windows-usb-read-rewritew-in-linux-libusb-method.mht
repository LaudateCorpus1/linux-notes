<h2>A GNU/Linux driver for the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-usb2</h2>

<p>
</p><div style=3D"margin-top: 3ex; margin-bottom: 4ex; margin-left: 3em;
            color: #d00000; font-size: 150%">
<i>Please read this first:
This page is kept here primarily for historical reference.
The canonical Linux driver for this device is Mike Isely&#x27;s
<a href=3D"http://www.isely.net/pvrusb2/pvrusb2.html">pvrusb2</a>
driver, which is part of the Linux kernel tree since 2.6.18.
If you want to use the device under BSD Unix (like for instance
FreeBSD or MacOS X), then the driver described here might still
be of some use since it uses the portable libusb interface.
</i>
</div>

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">WARNING:</span> This is not a finished, working =
driver yet.
And it&#x27;s not sponsored or approved by Hauppauge in any way either.
Hauppauge won&#x27;t even document the protocol that the PVR-usb2 deploys
on your computer&#x27;s USB bus. So don&#x27;t annoy them with any questions
you might have regarding this software, okay?

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">A note regarding hardware:</span> This web page =
is only concerned with the
<a href=3D"http://www.hauppauge.com/html/wintvpvrusb2_datasheet.htm">WinTV-=
PVR-usb <b><font size=3D"+3">2</font></b></a>
version of the Hauppauge WinTV family of products. If you have its
predecessor, the &quot;plain&quot; WinTV-PVR-usb, it won&#x27;t work with t=
he software
published here because the devices use different chipsets. If you have
that version of the hardware, take a look at
<a href=3D"http://sourceforge.net/projects/pvrusb">the kernel driver by And=
reas Gal</a>
instead.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">What I have done &amp; what you can download her=
e:</span> I have managed to
make the USB device function while connected to a Linux machine, by sending
it the same commands as the Windows driver sends to it, as determined by the
use of the excellent program
&quot;<a href=3D"http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/">usbsnoop</a>&q=
uot;
by Benoit Papillault. The effect is the capability to capture MPEG2 from
the Hauppauge device and write it to standard output, which means it can
be saved to a file or to a named pipe (if you want to stream it to some oth=
er
program or to another computer).

method, but <b>eliminates any need to use Windows</b> to get things going.

</li></ul>

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">How to use:</span> There are two methods, one th=
at lets
you try out different settings via the Hauppauge driver for Windows, and one
that just uses the same settings as the ones that I normally use, without
any need to install or boot any Microsoft software.

</p><hr>
<span class=3D"firstwords">Method 1:</span>

<p>
To begin with, you need to install the Hauppauge driver
for Windows on a machine that has the USB device connected. Then you need
to install
<a href=3D"http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/">usbsnoop</a>
on the same system. The latest version of usbsnoop is probably the best
one to use. Be sure to download a numbered version, not the one that lacks
a version number. I have been using usbsnoop-1.8. On your Linux or BSD
machine you also need to have
<a href=3D"http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb">libusb</a>
installed, including the header file &quot;usb.h&quot;.

</p><p>
Then perform the following steps:

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">1.</span> Boot Windows and start the Hauppauge W=
in2000 application. Select the
input source you want (for example &quot;Composite Video&quot; or one of th=
e tuner
channels), and also choose the video resolution you&#x27;ll be using. Then
quit Win2000.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">2.</span> Start the usbsnoop program and install=
 filters for the PVR-usb2 device.
Follow the instructions for &quot;usbsnoop&quot;. Then start Win2000 again =
and let
it run for a few seconds, then stop the program. Uninstall the usbsnoop
filters and close the program.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">3.</span> Boot into Linux and copy the usbsnoop =
log file from your Windows
file system (by mounting that partition read-only for example).

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">4.</span> Extract the firmware from the Windows =
driver binaries. You will
need to access the file &quot;pvrusb2_25_22329.exe&quot; from your Linux sy=
stem.
Then extract like this:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>mkdir foo
unzip -d foo pvrusb2_25_22329.exe
perl extract-firmware.pl foo/HCWUSB2.SYS
</pre>
</blockquote>
This will produce the files &quot;fx2-firmware.bin&quot; and &quot;xxx-firm=
ware.bin&quot;.
Only fx2-firmware.bin is used by this method. The other firmware is
also contained in the usbsnoop log and gets downloaded from there.
If you use Method 2 instead, this firmware will be uploaded from the file
xxx-firmware.bin. Note: the extracting script only knows of this particular
driver version. You need to change the file offsets in the script if you wa=
nt
to use another version of the Hauppauge driver.
<a href=3D"firmware.html">Here</a> is an explanation of how these offsets
are determined.
<p>
Alternatively you can cold-start the PVR-usb2 from Windows and just leave
it powered on.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">5.</span> Parse the usbsnoop log file (from step=
 3) like this:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>perl usbreplayprep.pl &lt; usbsnoop.log &gt; usbcommands.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">6.</span> Compile the C program:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>gcc -o usbreplay -g usbreplay.c -lusb
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">7.</span> Start capturing:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>perl capture.pl &gt; movie.mpg
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Break with ^C to stop capturing.

</p><hr>
<span class=3D"firstwords">Method 2:</span>

<p>
On your Linux or BSD machine you need to have
<a href=3D"http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb">libusb</a>
installed, including the header file &quot;usb.h&quot;.

</p><p>
Then perform the following steps:

</p><p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">1.</span> Extract the firmware from the Windows =
driver binaries. You will
need to access the file &quot;pvrusb2_25_22329.exe&quot; from your Linux sy=

</p><blockquote>
<pre>mkdir foo
unzip -d foo pvrusb2_25_22329.exe
perl extract-firmware.pl foo/HCWUSB2.SYS
</pre>
</blockquote>
This will produce the files &quot;fx2-firmware.bin&quot; and &quot;xxx-firm=
ware.bin&quot;.
Note: the extracting script only knows of this particular driver version.
You need to change the file offsets in the script if you want to use
another version of the Hauppauge driver. <a href=3D"firmware.html">Here</a>
is an explanation of how these offsets are determined.

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">2.</span> Create a file of USB commands needed
to initialize the device:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>perl create-usbcommands.pl xxx-firmware.bin &gt; usbcommands.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
This will combine some USB commands containing my typical settings with
the firmware that you extracted in step 1. Warning: there is no way of
knowing if these commands will result in entirely different effects
when used on your device. Don&#x27;t blame me if the thing explodes...

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">3.</span> Compile the C program:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>gcc -o usbreplay -g usbreplay.c -lusb
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">4.</span> Start capturing:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>perl capture.pl &gt; movie.mpg
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Break with ^C to stop capturing.

</p><hr>
Method 1 has been tested by me on an Intel P4 system running Linux 2.4.23-r=
c2
and on a Microsoft
<a href=3D"http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/">Xbox running Linux</a>
2.4.22-xbox, using the usb-uhci and the ohci host drivers, respectively.
It has also been reported to work on a 2.6.0-beta10 kernel with ehci,
and recently also on BSD Unix: MacOS X (version 10.3.6) on libusb 0.1.9 bet=
a 2004-10-23.
Method 2 is still very new and has so far only been tested on two machines =
in Europe with PAL B/G.

<p>
<span class=3D"firstwords">Why a userspace driver?</span> Well, the main re=
ason is that doing as much
as possible in user space makes development much more flexible. Bugs in
the code will be less disastrous, and scripting is more convenient.
If needed, the code can be turned into a kernel driver at a later stage.

</p><p>
The other reason is that it is an unnecessary pain in the **** to
use kernel drivers for things that can just as easily be done by a
userspace program. Sure, there are situations where you want to keep
some state information for each device within the kernel, but it&#x27;s
not necessary to put all the control logic in a kernel module. On the
contrary, if a userspace program and a more abstract API is used,
the logic can be separated from the nuts and bolts of the operating
system, and the chance is greater that the driver code will work
on other systems.

<span class=3D"firstwords">Frequently asked questions</span>
</p><p>
<span class=3D"faqlabel">Does this driver work with MythTV or Freevo?</span>
</p><p>
No, not yet. As far as I understand it, both
<a href=3D"http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a>
and
<a href=3D"http://freevo.sourceforge.net">Freevo</a>
require kernel device drivers that conform to the
<a href=3D"http://www.exploits.org/v4l/">Video for Linux</a>, aka &quot;v4l=
&quot;
specification. The present driver is much too primitive in its current
state, and it has no interface to the Linux kernel yet (except of course
in the form of the portable libusb interface). There are several things
that need to be identified and separated out from the USB initialization
sequence in order to create a v4l-conforming kernel driver.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"faqlabel">So is there any other PVR software that can be use=
d?</span>
</p><p>
As a matter of fact, yes there is. I wrote a &quot;lightweight&quot; PVR sy=
stem to
make the driver a little more useful in its current state. It&#x27;s called
<a href=3D"http://glotv.dax.nu/">GLOTV</a>.
<span style=3D"color: #d00000; font-weight: bold">
[Note: version 1.0 of GLOTV can be downloaded
<a href=3D"http://glotv.dax.nu/glotv1.0.tar.gz">here</a>
and it has built-in support for the libusb driver =97
this support has been removed in GLOTV 2.0 and later!]
</span>

</p><p>
<span class=3D"faqlabel">What privileges are needed to run the program?</sp=
an>
</p><p>
By default, you need root privileges to access the device through the
/proc/bus/usb/* files. If you don&#x27;t want to run the capture script as =
root,
you can either try configuring a USB policy daemon that gives you access,
or you can make &quot;usbreplay&quot; setuid-root. This is the easiest solu=
tion so
that&#x27;s what I do.

Added a new script &quot;create-usbcommands.pl&quot; that completely elimin=
ates the need
to connect the device to a Microsoft-infected machine during the installati=
on
process. <b>But:</b> this also hardwires the settings to the ones I normall=

i.e. 5-6 Mbit/s, 720x576 PAL. It might not work in your environment, and I =

Switching between TV tuner and RCA inputs is now possible, in the middle of
a session. At least it works for me. Please report back if you find differe=
nces
in the usbsnoop logs in your setup. Audio and video and the TV channel can =
be
switched separately, or all together. A new script &quot;changesource.pl&qu=
ot; is used
for this, and it obsoletes the old &quot;changechannel.pl&quot; script.
</p><p>
Also updated the firmware extraction script. The offsets are now adapted to
&quot;pvrusb2_23_21351.exe&quot;. The firmware itself hasn&#x27;t changed a=
s far as I could
determine.
</p><p>
(And yes, I lied in the previous news item about it being the last update o=
f the
current programs.)

</p><p>
<span class=3D"newslabel">
2004-02-07
</span><br>
New script added: &quot;changechannel.pl&quot;. It writes to a named pipe c=
reated
by &quot;capture.pl&quot; and read by &quot;usbreplay&quot; (these have als=
o been updated).
This will probably be the last update to these programs. It&#x27;s time to
redesign and rewrite the code...

</p><p>
<span class=3D"newslabel">
2004-02-02
</span><br>
Small update: &quot;capture.pl&quot; now saves the pid of the &quot;usbrepl=
ay&quot; process in
a file, and &quot;usbreplay.c&quot; drops any setuid privileges it might ha=
ve, immediately
after opening the usb device. This is to make it easier to manage the
capturing process from other programs.
<br>Also added a FAQ section to this web page.

</p><p>
<span class=3D"newslabel">

</span><br>
Fixed a bug in &quot;capture.pl&quot; that stopped some UHF channels from w=
orking.
The delimiting frequency is still 300 MHz. Maybe it should be much higher?

</p><p>
<span class=3D"newslabel">
2003-12-28
</span><br>
Updated &quot;capture.pl&quot; to include extremely rudimentary tuner suppo=
rt.
A command file must first be prepared like this: pick a command file that
works with the coaxial input. Find a line that looks like:

</p><blockquote>
<pre>00000000: 08 61 04 ** ** ce ** 81 af 55 4f
</pre>
</blockquote>

There may be several such lines. Pick the last one before the first
read-command from endpoint 84, and change it to:

<blockquote>
<pre>00000000: 08 61 04 $FREQ ce $B 81 af 55 4f
</pre>
</blockquote>

Then start &quot;capture.pl&quot; with this command file as the first argum=
ent
and the desired frequency in MHz as the second argument. The MHz number
must contain a decimal point. For example, the UHF channel known as &quot;3=
7&quot;
in PAL countries must be written as 599.25. VHF channel 6 is written 182.25
and so on. The spacing between channels is 7 MHz for VHF, 8 MHz for UHF.
For NTSC I think the spacing is 6 MHz, but I have only tested the tuner
with PAL sources.

Cold-starting can now be done from Linux. What was missing earlier was the
initialization of the CY7C68013 chip. This is done via the USB cable, but
for some unknown reason this transaction wasn&#x27;t visible in my usbsnoop=
 log.
An extra initialization stage has now been added to fix this.
