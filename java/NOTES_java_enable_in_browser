First off Firefox has removed npapi plugin support so use Firefox ESR  which is a shortlived fork allowing NPAPI for now

create plugins directory
	mkdir ~/.mozilla/plugins
	cd ~/.mozilla/plugins
Then symlink the java plugin "libnpjp2.so"
	ln -s /opt/java/jre1.8.0_91/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so
Now if the site/device is local etc need to add to exception list
	/opt/java/jre1.8.0_131/bin/ControlPanel
Goto Security tab and exception for your local device/website (requires https:// or http:// at beginning)

good to go.  will look for npapi compatible browsers later
