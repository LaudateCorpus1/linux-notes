    First we need to install these packages: sudo apt-get install dh-make devscripts

    Copy the script into an editor and save it as hello

    chmod u+x hello
    mkdir hello-0.1
    cp hello hello-0.1/

    cd hello-0.1/
    dh_make -s --indep --createorig
    grep -v makefile debian/rules > debian/rules.new
    mv debian/rules.new debian/rules
    echo hello usr/bin > debian/install
    echo "1.0" > debian/source/format
    rm debian/*.ex
    debuild -us -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i hello_0.1-1_all.deb

Now entering hello into the Terminal prints 'Hello World'.
