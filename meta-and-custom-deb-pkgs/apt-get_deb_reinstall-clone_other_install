a) Create a text file with all the currently installed applications:

sudo dpkg --get-selections > installed-applications.txt

b) To install all the packages from the "installed-applications.txt" to the fresh Ubuntu installation (or another computer), you have to run this:

sudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-applications.txt
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade


#########  TO CREATE A SMALL DEB (meta package deb, its whole job is just to point to many other apps, and have them installed) ############

a) Install equivs (sudo apt-get install equivs) then create a folder, pick a name for your meta-pkg and name the folder after that,and create control file

sudo apt-get install equivs
cd && mkdir bm16ton
cd bm16ton/
mkdir debian
cd debian/
equivs-control control

b) Create a list of currently installed apps (with applications seperated by commas for simple copy/paiste into control file)

cd
sudo aptitude search -F %p ~i --disable-columns libedataserver | sed 's/$/,/' | tr '\n\r' ' ' | sed 's/, $//' > installed-applications.txt

c) edit debian/control with sum basic pkg info and paiste the installed applications into it, heres a working example with the paiste spot pointed out (just add to depends line)
