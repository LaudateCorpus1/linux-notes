$@ is the name of the file being generated, and $< the first prerequisite (usually the source file). You can find a list of all these special variables in the GNU Make manual.

For example, consider the following declaration:

all: library.cpp main.cpp

In this case:

    $@ evaluates to all
    $< evaluates to library.cpp
    $^ evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp



The $@ and $< are called the automatic variables. The $@ is the output variable. $< is called the first input variable. For example:

hello.o: hello.c hello.h
         gcc -c $< -o $@

Here, hello.o is the output file. This is what $@ exapnds to. The first dependency is hello.c. That's what $< expands to.

The -c flag generates the .o file; see man gcc for a more detailed explanation. The -o specifies the file to output to.
