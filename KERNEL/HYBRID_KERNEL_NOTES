might wanna try adding the exported symbols found in ;;

linux-3.19-hybrid/debian.master/abi/3.19.0-42.48/amd64/generic 

to your own config especially if using the backported i915 drivers.


Also if the intel lpss driver is the issue, then cut all lines about ;;

i915_bpo_enabled 

from ;;

drivers/platform/x86/intel_ips.c
(also dont try and export the symbols in this file, if you copied them or used ubuntu config)

and add them sumwhere else, probly in the i915-bpo source.
