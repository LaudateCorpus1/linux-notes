YOU CAN QUERY THE CURRENT POWER STATE AND POLICY BY RUNNING AS ROOT:

 # cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
 0:DIS: :DynOff:0000:01:00.0
 1:IGD:+:Pwr:0000:00:02.0
 2:DIS-Audio: :Off:0000:01:00.1

EACH LINE OF THE OUTPUT IS OF THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

    A number: not important
    A string:
        DIS: Discrete GPU (your AMD or NVIDIA GPU)
        IGD: Integrated Graphics (your Intel card?)
        DIS-Audio: The audio device exported by your discrete GPU for HDMI sound playback
    A sign:
        '+': This device is connected to graphics connectors
        ' ': This device is not connected to graphics connectors
    A power state:
        OFF: The device is powered off
        ON: The device is powered on
        DynOff: The device is currently powered off but will be powered on when needed
        DynPwr: The device is currently powered on but will be powered off when not needed
    The PCI-ID of the device


TURN ON THE GPU THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY DRIVING THE OUTPUTS:

 echo ON > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

TURN OFF THE GPU THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY DRIVING THE OUTPUTS:

 echo OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

Connect the graphics connectors to the integrated GPU:

echo IGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

CONNECT THE GRAPHICS CONNECTORS TO THE DISCRETE GPU:

 echo DIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

PREPARE A SWITCH TO THE INTEGRATED GPU TO OCCUR WHEN THE X SERVER GETS RESTARTED:

 echo DIGD > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch

PREPARE A SWITCH TO THE DISCRETE GPU TO OCCUR WHEN THE X SERVER GETS RESTARTED:

 echo DDIS > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
