in order to link folders/directorys with ln -s you need to be inside the directory the new link is being created, and also the link folder cannot currently exist IE
(to link directory /home/user/poop1 into /home/user/poop2 you need to be in directory poop2 when you issue the command)

CORRECT;
user:~/home/user/poop2$ ln -s ../poop1 poop1

INCORRECT:
!!!! WILL NOT WORK !!!!! user:~/home/user$ ln -s poop1 poop2/poop1
