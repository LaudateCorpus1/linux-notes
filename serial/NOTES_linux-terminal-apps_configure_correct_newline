Configure terminal programs for correct display of newlines

Background;
When printing something using stdio (e.g., printf("Hello World!\n");, RIOT sends a line feed character (0xA) as '\n' (newline).
Some terminals need more, for example, a carriage return and a line feed character (0xD, 0xA). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline for background.
This page tries to collect needed settings for common terminal programs that will make them correctly display newlines.
