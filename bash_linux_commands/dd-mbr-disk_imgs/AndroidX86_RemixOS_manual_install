    Head down to android-x86 website and download the latest version (iso version).
    In my case it's Android-x86 4.4 r2
    Hit the terminal (Crtl+Alt+T).
    You can use the following bash commands to easily extract and copy the files.
    Extract the contents of the iso
    Code:

    7z x android-x86-4.4-r2.iso -oandroid_installation && \
    cd android_installation

    Extract the contents of the system.sfs
    Code:

    sudo -s && \
    unsquashfs -f -d . system.sfs && \
    mkdir temp && \
    mount -o loop system.img temp

    Now let's copy initrd.img ramdisk.img kernel files to the Android partition. Create 2 folders on the Android partition called data and system, extract system.sfs (and eventually system.img) and copy its contents to the system folder we just created.
    Code:

    cp initrd.img ramdisk.img kernel /path/to/the/android/partition &&\
    mkdir /path/to/the/android/partition/system && \
    mkdir /path/to/the/android/partition/data && \
    cp -avr temp/* /path/to/the/android/partition/system &&\
    umount temp &&\
    cd .. && \
    rm -rf android_installation &&\
    exit

    Now after copying all the necessary files to the Andorid partition, all we need to do is modify grub to boot from that partition.

    Code:

    sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom

    Quote:

    menuentry "Android Kitkat" {
    set root='(hd0,8)'
    linux /kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=android_x86 acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/ HWACCEL=
    initrd /initrd.img}
    You should change (hd0,8) entry based on your android partition location, the one that we wrote before.
    (hdX,Y) for /dev/sdXY with a corresponding to 0, b to 1, c to 2 etc ..
    In my case, my android partition is /dev/sda8 correspond to (hd0,8)
    a -> X=0
    8 -> Y=8
    So '(hd0,8)'
    Update Grub configuration by:
    Code:

    sudo update-grub

Bonus. Installing Xposed Framework.
As many probably faced the same problem, Xposed Framework presents an issue on intel devices, although there is a work around.
Here are the steps:

    Boot into Android.
    Download Xposed Framework Installer from dl.xposed.info/latest.apk
    Install it, but DO NOT RUN IT.
    Now hit the terminal emulator. It should be already installed on your system. Type the following:
    Code:

    su
    echo 148 > /data/data/de.robv.android.xposed.installer/conf/jit_reset_offset
    chmod 664 /data/data/de.robv.android.xposed.installer/conf/jit_reset_offset

    Run the installer, and install Xposed Framework.
    Reboot and enjoy
