 Bad Blocks

A bad sector is a sector on a computer’s disk drive that cannot be used due to permanent damage (or an OS inability to successfully access it), such as physical damage to the disk surface.

There are two ways to detect bad sectors in Linux: you can use the Disk Utility GUI, or if you are a command line geek like us, you can use the badblocks command to check your hard disk for bad sectors:

    sudo badblocks -v /dev/sdb1

Badblock will give us the number of bad sectors in our hard disk.


    zainul@zainul-laptop:~$ sudo badblocks -v /dev/sdb1
    Checking blocks 0 to 97683200
    Checking for bad blocks (read-only test): 3134528 done, 3:27 elapsed
    3134560 done, 8:33 elapsed
    3134561 done, 10:15 elapsed
    3134562 done, 11:57 elapsed
    3134563 done, 13:39 elapsed
    done
    Pass completed, 5 bad blocks found.

You have two options when you see bad blocks. You can either look for a new hard disk, or mark these bad blocks as unusable hard disk sectors. This involves two steps:

First we have to write the location of the bad sectors into a flat file.

    sudo badblocks /dev/sdb > /home/zainul/bad-blocks

After that, we need to feed the flat file into the FSCK command to mark these bad sectors as ‘unusable’ sectors.

    sudo fsck -l bad-blocks /dev/sdb

FSCK, Badblocks, and Disk Utility are some of the disk utilities that we often use to scan our hard disks. Do share with the other fellow readers if you know other Linux disk utilities to scan hard disks.
