To run commands (IE to change txpower) in /etc/network/interfaces try the up option described under "IFACE OPTIONS" here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man5/interfaces.5.html

It, and similar options like pre-up, etc. allow you to execute arbitrary commands at various points during the configuration of your interface. So your /etc/network/interfaces might look like

##########################################################################################################

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    wpa-ssid <my ssid>
    wpa-psk <my psk>
    address <address>
    netmaks <netmask>
    gateway <gateway>

    # Command options with the same label (e.g. "up", "pre-up") are executed in the
    #  order in which they're specified.
    up iw reg set ...
    up iwconfig wlan0 txpower ...

    # If you have `rfkill` installed and want to disable (all) WiFi transmission
    #  while this interface is down.
    post-down rfkill wifi

You should also be able to use the option wireless-txpower Requires the wireless-tools (i.e. iwconfig) package installed, but I'm not sure how the sequencing of your commands would work in that case. Some (sparse) information on the wireless-[ ] options here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man7/wireless.7.html

DESCRIPTION

       The  Wireless Extensions is an API allowing you manipulate Wireless LAN
       networking interfaces.  It is  composed  of  a  variety  of  tools  and
       configuration  files.  It  is  documented  in  more detail in the Linux
       Wireless LAN Howto.
       The Wireless Tools are used to change the configuration of wireless LAN
       networking  interfaces  on the fly, to get their current configuration,
       to get statistics and diagnose them. They are described  in  their  own
       man page, see below for references.
       Wireless configuration is specific to each Linux distribution. This man
       page will contain in the future the configuration procedure for  a  few
       common   distributions.   For   the   time   being,   check   the  file
       DISTRIBUTIONS.txt included with the Wireless Tools package.

DEBIAN 3.0

       In Debian 3.0 (and later) you can  configure  wireless  LAN  networking
       devices using the network configuration tool ifupdown(8).

       File : /etc/network/interfaces

       Form : wireless-<function> <value>
              wireless-essid Home
              wireless-mode Ad-Hoc

       See also :
              /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/wireless-tools
              /usr/share/doc/wireless-tools/README.Debian

SuSE 8.0

       SuSE  8.0  (and  later)  has integrated wireless configuration in their
       network scripts.

       Tool : Yast2

       File : /etc/sysconfig/network/wireless
              /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*

       Form : WIRELESS_<function>=<value>
              WIRELESS_ESSID="Home"
              WIRELESS_MODE=Ad-Hoc
