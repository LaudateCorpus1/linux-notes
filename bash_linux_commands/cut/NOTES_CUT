CUT

REMOVE FIRST FOUR DIGITS FROM OUTPUT

echo abcdefghjkim | cut -c 5-
		OUTPUTS: efghjkim

REMOVE LAST FOUR DIGITS FROM OUTPUT (using rev to reverse output then again to bring it back to normal)

string="elephant"
echo "$string" | rev | cut -c 5- | rev

IF YOU WANT TO USE CUT WITHOUT REVERSING THE STRING YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT THE LENGTH OF THE STRING FIRST THEN SUBTRACT THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS YOU WANT CROPPED. THIS IS A HASSLE, BUT CAN STILL BE DONE FAIRLY EASILY:

string="elephant"
let len=${#string}-4
echo "$string" | cut -c 1-$len

	OR HARDER TO READ, BUT MORE CONCISELY:

string="elephant"
echo "$string" | cut -c 1-$((${#string}-4))

SHOW ONLY THIRD CHARACTOR

echo abcdefghjkim | cut --characters=3
		OUTPUTS: c

SHOW FROM THIRD CHARACTOR ON

echo abcdefghjkim | cut --characters=3-
		OUTPUTS: cdefghjkim
