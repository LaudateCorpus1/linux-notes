Limitation of DKMS

1. DKMS may not work well after a large change of kernel ABI - Using DKMS on a stable release kernel will be a better idea.
2. Make sure the we have toolchains and kernel header installed.
3. Using DKMS on a netbook is not a smart idea - It takes too much time to build the kernel module after kernel upgrading.
4. DKMS modules will not be loaded if there are another ones in initrd.
