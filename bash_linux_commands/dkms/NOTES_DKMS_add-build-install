Now, use "dkms add" to tell DKMS we have a module is ready. DKMS will create symlink from /var/lib/dkms to /usr/src.

	sudo dkms add -m hello -v 0.1

				Creating symlink /var/lib/dkms/hello/0.1/source ->
				                 /usr/src/hello-0.1
								DKMS: add Completed.


Then, you can try to build this module with "DKMS build".

	sudo dkms build -m hello -v 0.1

And, you can install this module to the kernel module tree.

	sudo dkms install -m hello -v 0.1




You can also ask DKMS to build and install this module for another kernel version after "dkms add".

	sudo dkms build -m hello -v 0.1 -k 4.4.0-57-generic

It is also possible to build against multiple kernel versions.

	sudo dkms build -m hello -v 0.1 -k 4.4.0-57-generic -k 4.4.0-58-generic
