### wifi.cloned-mac-address=  and  ethernet.cloned-mac-address=  options;

    00:00:00:00:00:00 An explict MAC address: this was already supported before 1.4.0 and allows to spoof a specific MAC address.
    “permanent”: use the permanent MAC address of the device. Before 1.4.0, the permanent MAC address was used if the “cloned-mac-address” property was left empty, thus it was the default.
    “preserve”: don’t change the MAC address of the device upon activation.
    “random”: generate a randomized value upon each connect.
    “stable”: generate a stable, hashed MAC address.
    NULL/unset: this is the default value which allows fallback to a globally configured default, see below. In case no global override exists, NetworkManager falls back to “permanent”, like it did before.

### wifi.mac-address-randomization= options;
DEFAULT = 0,
NEVER = 1,
ALWAYS = 2,


###  This doesnt seem to do anything
# /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

### This is slightly better
# /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/300-mac-randomization.conf

[device-mac-randomization]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[connection-mac-randomization]
ethernet.cloned-mac-address=permanent
wifi.cloned-mac-address=42:33:1e:bd:d1:51
