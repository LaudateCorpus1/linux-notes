PAR/SER/             Parallel/Serial/Byte Interface Selection
BYTE SEL             Input. Logic input. If this pin is tied to a logic low, the parallel interface is selected. If this pin is tied to a logic high,the serial interface is selected. Parallel byte       
                     interface  mode is selected when this pin is logic high and DB15/BYTE SEL is logic high (see Table 8).In serial mode, 
                     the RD/SCLK pin functions as the serial clock input. The DB7/DOUTA pin and the DB8/DOUTB pin function as serial data outputs.     
                     DB[6:0] pins should be tied to ground.

STBY                Standby Mode Input.
RANGE               Analog Input Range Selection. Logic input. The polarity  on this pin deter-mines the input range of the analog input channels. If this pin is tied to a logic high, the  analog input range is ±10 V for all channels. 
                    If this pin  is tied to a logic low, the analog input range is ±5 V  for all channels

BUSY                pulled high busy, low readyto read IRQ?

DB0:6               IN SPI PULL TO AGND

VDRIVE              Logic Power Supply Input. The voltage (2.3 V to 5.25 V) supplied at this pin determines the operating voltage of the interface

DB7/DOUTA           DOUTA and outputs serial conversion data
DB8/DOUTB           Serial Interface Data Output Pin

DB[13:9]            SPI   these pins should be tied to AGND

DB14/HBEN           SPI     this pin should be tied to GND

DB15/BYTE SEL       When PAR/SER/BYTE SEL = 1 and DB15/BYTE SEL = 0, the AD7606 operates in serial interface mode

REFGND             AGND

V1-8             This pin is a single-ended analog input
