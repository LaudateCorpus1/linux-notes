<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In the subject called
<abbr title="Periféricos e Interfícies">PI</abbr>
-Periferals and Interfaces- at the
<abbr title="Facultad de Informática de Barcelona">FIB</abbr>
(UPC, Public University of Catalonia)
we used a <em>development board</em> at the practices.
You connect it to a computer and transfer the programs,
which can control the buttons, write on the LCD screen, or
communicate with the computer or other devices.
</p>
<p>
We used proprietary programs which only worked on Windows, so I looked
for a way to do the same but on any operating system, and with
free (as in freedom) and <em>gratis</em> programs, so that anyone could
study them.
</p>
<p>
This isn't finished, but it's a starting point to anyone who were
looking for this. At least you won't need to start from zero.

<h2>Description of the board</h2>
<p>
It's a little tricky to understand <em>what</em> the board is.
Starting from the most general, we have:
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/placa_pi.jpg"><img src="EZ-USB%20board%20on%20Linux_files/mplaca_pi.jpg" alt="The famous development board used at PI" border="0" align="right"></a>
</p>
<p>
The board has been designed and set up by the teachers of the subject (PI);
they bought some pieces at electronic shops and they put them together.
Among these pieces are: <em>dot matrix</em>, buttons, memory (64 Kb), serial
and USB connectors, and the
<abbr title="microcontroller">μC</abbr> AN2131QC,
and furthermore some LEDs, resistors, transistors, and others.
</p>
<p>
The main component at the board is the microcontroller AN2131QC, from
the company <a href="http://www.cypress.com/">Cypress</a> (which bought Anchor
Chips, the original producer). The AN2131Q is a product of the
EZ-USB family from Cypress. Other microcontrollers (AN2122T, AN2135S, etc) have
somewhat different characteristics (more USB <em>endpoints</em>, or faster ports,
for instance).
</p>
<p>
This microcontroller, AN2131QC, has several important components, such as
a 8 Kb memory, a UART (it has two), and of course the processor, which is
an improved 8051. The original
<a href="http://www.microcontroller.com/embedded/references/faqs/8051-microcontroller-faq.htm">8051</a>
was made by Intel at 1980, bit now is produced by other companies, like 
Atmel. It's an 8 bits CPU with 256 bytes of RAM, 2 or 3 timers, 5 or 6
interrupts, 4 ports (of 8 bits), and serial port. The improvements made by Cypress
with their EZ-USB is that it runs faster, operates at 3.3V, has a third counter
(16 bits), and more.
</p>
<p>
The good thing is that the assembler code of the 8051 CPU still works on the
microcontroller AN2131, so the board used in PI can also be programmed
with code compatible with the 8051. In addition, some extra functions must
be used to access everything related to just the EZ-USB.
</p>
<p>
There exist other development boards which use the AN2131QC from Cypress,
for example:
<a href="http://www.minford.ca/html/mf3001.html">MF3001</a>,
<a href="http://www.devasys.com/usbi2cio.htm">USB I2C/IO</a>,
<a href="http://www.jged.com/web_pages/usbsimm.html">USBSIMM</a>;
and if you don't like them,
<a href="http://www.k9spud.com/ezproto/">make one yourself</a>.
</p>
<a name="toc3"></a>
<h2>Original behaviour (and in Windows)</h2>
<p>
To make our program run in the board, we had to follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write the high-level code.</strong> We used a sort of somewhat unclean C
    (it seems that everything we were taught about modular
    and structured programming doesn't apply here). Beware of the code:
    <code>a=5;</code> doesn't mean that <code>a</code> gets set the value 5, but
    it might be a call to a hardware function.
    Sometimes just changing the order of assignments
    (<code>b=0;a=0;</code> instead of <code>a=0;b=0;</code>) solved the problems.

</li><li><strong>Compile it.</strong> You need a <em>cross compiler</em> since the desired processor
    is the 8051, not x86. We used
    <a href="http://www.keil.com/uvision2/">Keil μVision 2</a>. After compiling,
    the object file is linked with a library provided by Cypress, called
    EZUSB.LIB and present in all programs.
    The result of the compilation is a file with extension HEX which follows
    the
    <a href="http://margo.student.utwente.nl/el/misc/intl_hex.htm">specification</a>
    from Intel.

</li><li><strong>Load the code in the board.</strong> There's a program, <em>Cypress Control Panel</em>,
    to transfer (<em>download</em>) this HEX file to the board via USB.

</li><li><strong>Look at the board to see if it works.</strong> Just after the
    transfer, it starts running and we have to test (by using the buttons
    and LCD screen) whether it does what it was intended. If something
    doesn't work, change the code and repeat the process until you run
    out of patience. You can also use debuggers and simulators, but
    we were not taught that at PI.
</li></ol>

<p>
So the two tools used are: Keil (compiler) and the loader from Cypress.
I haven't exhaustively studied them as they only run on Windows,
but what I have tried is to find a way to do the same, but using only
crossplattform, no cost, and hopefully <em>free</em> software (which we can
study). And not a demo, like Keil (at some subjects, like
<abbr title="Sistemas Digitales y Microcontroladores">SDMI</abbr>
students could not compile large projects since the demo
was limited in size).
</p>
<a name="toc4"></a>
<h2>Loading an hex in the board (fxload)</h2>
<p>
I explain this first because is the easiest part. We have an <code>.hex</code>
(already compiled) and want the board to run it.
</p>
<p>
In kernel 2.6, the ability to transfer to the EZ-USB board is already
incorporated in the kernel. You just need the program <code>fxload</code>, and a
command like <code>fxload -I DosPunts.hex</code> is sufficient to make the
board start running the just transferred code. In kernel 2.4 you
must use <a href="http://ezusb2131.sourceforge.net/">this driver</a>.
</p>
<p>
So that you can test, here there is an example program:
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/DosPunts.hex">DosPunts.hex</a>. It shines two points at the
<em>dot matrix</em>, and does nothing else.
</p>
<a name="toc5"></a>
<h2>Compiling C code to create the .hex (sdcc)</h2>
<p>
This needs a <em>cross-compiler</em> for the specific language we want.
For C or C dialects, there are several
<a href="http://ee.cleversoul.com/8051_compilers.html">8051 compilers</a>.
Among them there's <a href="http://www.keil.com/c51/c51.htm">C51</a> (the one found in
Keil, expensive and for MS-DOS) and <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a>
(free software, <em>gratis</em>, crossplatform, and including a lot of other tools).
</p>
<p>
You can compile code written in several other languages, both high and low level.
For ASM (assembler), the known ones are
<a href="http://www.keil.com/c51/a51.htm">A51</a> (from Keil),
<a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.html/node34.html">asx8051</a>
(from sdcc), and others.
</p>
<p>
The one I have decided to use in Linux is sdcc (it seems it's the most complete,
and in addition it's free software).
To create the <code>hex</code> you have to do so:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Write code in that pseudo-C, in a file like <code>file.c</code>
</li><li>Run <code>sdcc file.c</code>, possibly passing it some options like <code>-I</code>
to specify where are the <em>includes</em>.
This creates a lot of files:
<code>.asm</code>,
<code>.ihx</code>,
<code>.lnk</code>,
<code>.lst</code>,
<code>.map</code>,
<code>.mem</code>,
<code>.rel</code>,
<code>.rst</code>,
<code>.sym</code>.
If what you were compiling was assembler,
it's done with <code>asx8051 -o file.asm</code>
and after that, <code>sdcc file.rel</code>.
</li><li>Convert the <code>ihx</code> to <code>hex</code> with <code>packihx file.ihx &gt;file.hex</code>.
</li></ol>

<p>
To compile projects which have several files, compile each one individually
with flag <code>-c</code> and then link them together, putting the <em>main.c</em> first.
SDCC manual explains this better.
</p>
<p>
And something else:
due to the architecture of the PI board, <code>sdcc</code> will need some parameters
like
<code>--code-loc 0x0080 --xram-loc 0x1000 --iram-size 256 --model-small</code>
(well, default model is <em>small</em> anyway).
I found these data at the Keil configuration at the laboratories.
</p>
<p>
All this works; the problem is that at the EZ-USB board,
most of the functions needed to access the hardware are implemented
in an extern <em>library</em>, called EZUSB.LIB. For instance,
in this program, <a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/DosPunts.c">DosPunts.c</a>, it can be seen that
almost the whole code are custom functions (EZUSB_WriteI2C, EZUSB_Delay, ...).
</p>
<a name="toc6"></a>
<h2>ezregs.h, ezusb.h and others</h2>
<p>
At the examples we included (<code>#include</code>) two header files:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ezregs.h</code> tells the address for each register in the board,
both for the internal microcontroller (8051) and for
the ones added by Cypress.
</li><li><code>ezusb.h</code> declares the structures and functions specific to the
EZ-USB bourd (EZUSB_InitI2C, etc)
</li></ul>

<p>
These files, and others found at the directory <em>include</em> of the program,
also need modification to be able to compile without problems.
The originals are here:
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/include-orig.tar.gz">include-orig.tar.gz</a>,
and the fixed version is in this folder:
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/include-fix/">include-fix/</a>
(also in this <a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/fixed.tar.gz">tar.gz</a>).
I hope I don't disturb anyone by distributing them.
</p>
<p>
The changes I made to them are:
</p>
<a name="toc7"></a>
<h3>Lowercase names</h3>
<p>
On Windows, each program referenced the files in a different manner.
I have renamed them all to lowercase; for instance <code>ezregs.h</code>
(formerly <code>EZRegs.h</code>) so that it is easy to work with them.
And by the way, I have indented them and removed the TABs.
</p>
<a name="toc8"></a>
<h3>Register definitions for the 8051</h3>
<p>
At <code>ezregs.h</code> we have the memory address by which each
<abbr title="Special Function Register">SFR</abbr> from the board
can be accessed.
<code>sdcc</code> already provides a similar file,
at <code>/usr/share/sdcc/include/8051.h</code>;
the addresses of both do agree, but the problem is that our micro
is an <em>extended</em> 8051 (not to be confused with the 8052), and
there are definitions which are missing in the file from sdcc.
For instance, in the original there's just <code>SBUF</code>, but the one
from Cypress has <code>SBUF0</code> and <code>SBUF1</code>.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the sdcc file is useful to learn the syntax which the register
definitions have to follow. It should be something like:
<code>sfr at 0x8D TH1;</code> but the Keil format is
<code>sfr TH1 = 0x8D;</code>.
Both use <code>sfr</code> for register names
and <code>sbit</code> for names of bits inside registers.
I have corrected this (by using regular expressions it's done very fast).
</p>
<a name="toc9"></a>
<h3>Don't abuse the preprocessor</h3>
<p>
At <code>ezregs.h</code> there's also the definition of registers found at the
EZ-USB board (not at the 8051), such as the ones we need to use the USB.
They are <code>xdata</code> registers, so they have to be accessed as if they were
at the external RAM.
</p>
<p>
The bad point is that they are doing a filthy trick with preprocessor:
</p>
<pre>  #ifdef ALLOCATE_EXTERN
  #define EXTERN
  #define _AT_ _at_
  #else                           /*  */
  #define EXTERN extern
  #define _AT_ ;/ ## /
  #endif                          /*  */
  
  /* Register Assignments 3/18/99 TPM */
  EXTERN xdata volatile BYTE OUT7BUF[64] _AT_ 0x7B40;
  EXTERN xdata volatile BYTE IN7BUF[64] _AT_ 0x7B80;
  EXTERN xdata volatile BYTE OUT6BUF[64] _AT_ 0x7BC0;
</pre>

<p>
And like that, for all registers. The intention is the change <code>_AT_</code> to <code>;//</code> to
ignore the right half of several lines.
</p>
<p>
This doesn't please sdcc
(<code>warning: pasting "/" and "/" does not give a valid preprocessing token</code>);
and neither to me (in fact, <code>gcc</code> also joins our complaining, with normal C).
I have changed that to something more elegant:
</p>
<pre>  #ifdef ALLOCATE_EXTERN
  #define NEWEZREG(_name,_where,_size) volatile xdata at _where _size _name
  #else                           /*  */
  #define NEWEZREG(_name,_where,_size) extern volatile xdata _size _name
  #endif                          /*  */
  
  /* Register Assignments 3/18/99 TPM */
  NEWEZREG(OUT7BUF[64],0x7B40,BYTE);
  NEWEZREG(IN7BUF[64],0x7B80,BYTE);
  NEWEZREG(OUT6BUF[64],0x7BC0,BYTE);
</pre>

<p>
With that, <code>ezregs.h</code> is fixed;
<code>fx2regs.h</code> and <code>fx.h</code> also need the same change.
</p>
<a name="toc10"></a>
<h3>The .inc</h3>
<p>
These 6 files are included when you program in assembler:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ezbits.inc
 sets some bits to a few USB registers.
</li><li>ezregs.inc
 contains the same as ezregs.h but for the ASM.
</li><li>fx2regs.inc
 is like fx2regs.h (for chip EZ-USB FX2).
</li><li>fx.inc
 is the same as fx.h (for chip EZ-USB FX).
</li><li>macros.inc
 has 5 simple macros for assembler.
</li><li>reg320.inc
 has nothing; it's there to maintain backwards compatibility.
</li></ul>

<p>
They use the Keil syntax,
but they are so seldom used that I preferred not to change them.
I will talk of them again.
</p>
<a name="toc11"></a>
<h2>EZUSB.LIB library</h2>
<p>
The functions to work with the components added by Cypress
are in the library file EZUSB.LIB,
and they are more or less <a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/symbols_lib.txt">these</a>.
When we worked with Keil (Windows),
at each project we had to include the file
EZUSB.LIB so that it got linked with the compiled code;
the problem is that the original EZUSB.LIB is in the format
which understands Keil, but that's not the same of the one
used in sdcc libraries.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately and not hoping it, I found a diretory with all the
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/ezusb-orig.tar.gz">source code of the EZUSB library</a> in a Keil installation.
But it's prepared to compile only with the environment and syntax of
Keil (using C51 and A51).
I hope I don't disturb anyone if I distribute this here.
</p>
<p>
After a lot of work, I ported all the C and ASM code of this library
to a format which sdcc could understand.
The result is in
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/ezusb-fix/">ezusb-fix/</a>
(also in this <a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/fixed.tar.gz">tar.gz</a>);
will Cypress get angry if I publish fixes for their code?.
</p>
<p>
Despite the codes were simple, I have fixed several errors.
Now I will explain the changes that were needed.
</p>
<a name="toc12"></a>
<h3>Creation of a library</h3>
<p>
According to Cypress, EZUSB.LIB is created using <code>C51</code> to compile each <code>.c</code>
separately and <code>A51</code> for each <code>.a51</code>, also separately.
Then you must create an empty library, with <code>LIB51</code>, and add all of the
generated object files except the ones for
<code>2200jmpt.a51</code>, <code>FXJmpTb.a51</code>, <code>renum.a51</code>, <code>USBJmpTb.a51</code>.
</p>
<p>
According to sdcc, a <code>.lib</code> is just a list of <code>.rel</code> files,
which are the object code, result of the
individual compilation of each
<code>.c</code> or <code>.asm</code> (by using <code>-c</code>).
It's so easy: just a list with the file names, one per line.
</p>
<p>
 In addition, a <code>.lib</code> from sdcc may also contain all the code
(so that it ends up being in just one file), and the format is
equally simple: by using <code>sdcclib</code>, the content of each
<code>rel</code> (which is plain text) is included, and they are
classified by using a tags system similar to HTML.
On the other hand, the Keil format is binary, and
not easy to understand (at least by me).
</p>
<p>
Then, my goal is to <em>fix</em> the 13 files
<code>delay.c</code>,
<code>delayms.a51</code>,
<code>discon.c</code>,
<code>EZRegs.c</code>,
<code>get_cnfg.c</code>,
<code>get_dscr.c</code>,
<code>get_infc.c</code>,
<code>get_strd.c</code>,
<code>i2c.c</code>,
<code>i2c_rw.c</code>,
<code>resume.c</code>,
<code>susp.a51</code>,
<code>usbirqcl.a51</code>,
compile them separately, and join them in a librray to make my
own <code>ezusb.lib</code>.
</p>
<a name="toc13"></a>
<h3>Lowercase names</h3>
<p>
To compile the library on Linux, the <code>#include</code> have to reference
the correct file (agreeing even with the upper and lower case).
I have changed in all files things like
<code>#include "..\inc\Fx.h"</code> to <code>#include &lt;fx.h&gt;</code>.
</p>
<a name="toc14"></a>
<h3>stdlib.h instead of stdio.h</h3>
<p>
<code>get_cnfg.c</code>, <code>get_dscr.c</code>, <code>get_infc.c</code>, <code>get_strd.c</code> needed
the symbol <code>NULL</code>, which is in <code>stdlib.h</code>, not <code>stdio.h</code>.
<code>i2c.c</code> directly didn't need it.
</p>
<a name="toc15"></a>
<h3>Conversion to xdata* at get_infc.c</h3>
<p>
It says this when compiling:
</p>
<pre>  get_infc.c:16: warning: function return value mismatch
  from type 'struct __00010003 generic* '
  to type 'struct __00010003 xdata-xdata* '
</pre>

<p>
The relevant part of code is (the 16 is the <code>return</code>):
</p>
<pre>  INTRFCDSCR xdata*       EZUSB_GetIntrfcDscr(BYTE ConfigIdx, BYTE IntrfcIdx, BYTE AltSetting)
  {
  ...
  INTRFCDSCR      *intrfc_dscr;
  ...
  intrfc_dscr = (INTRFCDSCR xdata *)((WORD)config_dscr + config_dscr-&gt;length);
  return(intrfc_dscr);
  ...
</pre>

<p>
The function should return a <code>xdata*</code> ("pointer to the RAM external to the 8051"),
but in the <code>small</code> model we are using in compilation, local variables are placed
by default in internal RAM (storage type <code>data</code>).
</p>
<p>
I don't think that USB descriptors are located in <code>data</code> (the 128/256 bytes of internal RAM),
so declaring it <code>xdata*</code> it will solve it:
</p>
<pre>  INTRFCDSCR      xdata *intrfc_dscr;
</pre>

<a name="toc16"></a>
<h3>volatile at I2CPckt</h3>
<p>
The error compiling <code>i2c.c</code>:
</p>
<pre>  i2c.c:5: error: extern definition for 'I2CPckt' mismatches with declaration.
  from type 'struct __00010007'
  to type 'volatile-struct __00010007'
</pre>

<p>
Line to blame:
<code>I2CPCKT volatile        I2CPckt;</code>.
But at <code>ezusb.h</code> it says that <code>extern I2CPCKT I2CPckt;</code>, so that doesn't match.
</p>
<p>
There are two options: add <code>volatile</code> wherever needed, or remove it where it appears.
I think that if they put it, there must be some reason, so I add it too to <code>ezusb.h</code> and <code>fx2.h</code>:
</p>
<pre>  extern I2CPCKT volatile I2CPckt;
</pre>

<a name="toc17"></a>
<h3>function cannot return 'bit'</h3>
<p>
At <code>i2c.c</code> and <code>i2c_rw.c</code> there are some functions which return <code>BOOL</code>:
</p>
<pre>  /* en i2c.c */
  BOOL EZUSB_WriteI2C_(BYTE addr, BYTE length, BYTE xdata *dat);
  BOOL EZUSB_ReadI2C_(BYTE addr, BYTE length, BYTE xdata *dat);
  /* en i2c_rw.c */
  BOOL EZUSB_ReadI2C(BYTE addr, BYTE length, BYTE xdata *dat)
  BOOL EZUSB_WriteI2C(BYTE addr, BYTE length, BYTE xdata *dat)
</pre>

<p>
According to <code>ezusb.h</code>, it's said that <code>typedef bit BOOL;</code>, but a function returning a single bit
is not allowed. In fact, the ones from <code>i2c.c</code> return <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>, which
are defined (<code>#define</code>) at <code>ezusb.h</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> respectively, so they can
be normal integers.
The strange part is that the ones from <code>i2c_rw.c</code> return constants like
<code>I2C_OK</code>, <code>I2C_NACK</code>, <code>I2C_BERROR</code>,
with values 8, 7 and 6 respectively. I can't understand the meaning of 
that transformation to bit; sdcc is doing well by complaining because of
 that.
</p>
<p>
I have changed the return type to <code>BYTE</code>, changing the headers at <code>i2c.c</code>, <code>i2c_rw.c</code> and
<code>ezusb.h</code> and <code>fx2.h</code>. In theory a byte can function in the same way as a bit: 0 means false, and different to 0, true.
But this change may make some older programs (which wanted to get a <code>BOOL</code>) stop compiling now.

<h3>Transforming the Keil assembler to sdcc</h3>
<p>
To complete EZUSB.LIB there still are 3 assembler files:
<code>delayms.a51</code>,
<code>susp.a51</code>,
<code>usbirqcl.a51</code>,
which include (in the sense of <code>#include</code>) to
<code>ezregs.inc</code>,
even when there are 6 <em>include</em>s:
<code>ezbits.inc</code>
<code>ezbits.inc</code>
<code>ezregs.inc</code>
<code>fx2regs.inc</code>
<code>fx.inc</code>
<code>macros.inc</code>
<code>reg320.inc</code>
.
</p>
<p>
The syntax used by asx8051 (the compiler found in sdcc) is very different to the
one from A51 (the assembler compiler from Keil).
It's worth studying the <code>.asm</code> which sdcc generates when it compiles C.
</p>
<p>
In asx8051 there are some differences respect from A51:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Global symbols (tags accessible from outside) are specified with
<code>.globl</code> (or with <code>tag::</code>).
Then you don't need the <code>-g</code> when compiling.
</li><li>Files are included with <code>.include</code>
</li><li>Constants (<code>equ</code>) are done with <code>NAME = value</code>
</li><li>You must use <code>.area CSEG (CODE)</code> before the code.
</li><li>The hexadecimal values are written with <code>0xVALUE</code>, and binary
with <code>0bVALUE</code>. In A51 they have the letter at the end.
</li><li>You don't need the <code>end</code> instruction at the bottom of each file.
</li><li>Keil ignores everything about upper/lower case, and even when in your
code you're calling <code>EZUSB_Delay1ms</code>, for instance, at the assembler
there's only defined the symbol <code>EZUSB_DELAY1MS</code>.
</li><li>Symbols created by asx8051 must have the prefix <code>_</code> (it means
<em>external symbol</em>). sdcc adds it automatically when compiling C.
</li></ul>

<p>
Instead of fixing the 3 <code>.a51</code>, I have created 3 <code>.asm</code> files with the
code written in the syntax of asx8051,
which -in my opinion- is clearer than A51's.
Since data from the <em>include</em> was scarcely used (just to obtain the address
of the SFR <code>USBCS</code>, <code>PCON</code> and <code>EXIF</code>),
I have repeated the declaration of those registers where needed, and I haven't
used <em>include</em>s.
</p>
<p>
I hope to have converted the files correctly.

<h3>Testing the library</h3>
<p>
Once the 13 files (10 C and 3 ASM) have been compiled, there have been
no problems creating <code>ezusb.lib</code> from the 13 <code>.rel</code> with <code>sdcclib</code>.
</p>
<p>
Using the corrected header files
(<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/include-fix/">include-fix/</a>)
and the corrected library
(<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/ezusb-fix/">ezusb-fix/</a>)
I can now compile
<a href="https://www.danielclemente.com/placa_pi/DosPunts.c">DosPunts.c</a>
with:
</p>
<pre>  echo OPCS="--code-loc 0x0080 --xram-loc 0x1000 --iram-size 256 --model-small"
  sdcc -I ../include-fix -L ../ezusb-fix -l ezusb $OPCS DosPunts.c
  packihx DosPunts.ihx &gt;DosPunts.hex
</pre>

<p>
I tried simulating the hex with s51 (it comes with sdcc): <code>s51 DosPunts.hex</code>.
It's not very appropriate since the PI board is not an 8051
(for instance, it has 256 bytes of RAM instead of 128).
In the simulation, s51 said:
</p>
<pre>  ...
  Error: invalid address 0x82 in memory iram.
     0x04ad f6       MOV   @R0,A
  Error: invalid address 0x81 in memory iram.
     0x04ad f6       MOV   @R0,A
  Error: invalid address 0x80 in memory iram.
     0x04ad f6       MOV   @R0,A
</pre>

<p>
That's logical, since at the 8051 (which is what it's simulating), there
are just 128 (0x7f) bytes of RAM, and beyond 0x80 there live the SFRs.
You can blame the initialization code which sdcc adds to empty the RAM:
</p>
<pre>  ...
  ; starting with r0=0 and a=0
  00005$: mov     @r0,a
          djnz    r0,00005$
  ;       _mcs51_genRAMCLEAR() end
</pre>

<p>
This is like <code>i=0; do { mem[i]=0; i--; } while (i!=0);</code>.
That's effective, but the simulator complains.
You may add <code>--no-xinit-opt</code> when compiling to stop generating this
initialization code and avoid <em>warning</em>s (but face the consequences),
or ask s51 to perform as an 8052, which has the full 256 bytes:
<code>s51 -t 8052</code> (even when our board <em>is not</em> an 8052).

<h2>Summary of what I have done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find a C and ASM compiler and a way to create the <code>hex</code> and load them
in the board.
</li><li>Fix the header files from Keil so that we can compile with <code>sdcc</code>.
</li><li>Fix the source code of the library which contains the functions added by Cypress,
and create the <code>ezusb.lib</code> which can be used with <code>sdcc</code>.
</li><li>Create the hex file for some simple example which uses EZ-USB technologies.
</li></ul>

<a name="toc21"></a>
<h2>What still has to be done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Further test the new <code>ezusb.lib</code> with sdcc.
</li><li>Better understand the memory map of the board.
Correctly place each section (CODE, DATA, XDATA, BIT, ...).
</li><li>Try some hex generated by sdcc in the real board.
Also in a good simulator.
</li><li>Achieve the correct compilation of all practises and exercices of PI.
</li><li>Do a simple script to compile a C file (or use Makefile).
</li><li>For the USB part, use projects like
<a href="http://ezhid.sourceforge.net/">EzHID</a>
</li><li>Look for more tools which help the development process with this board:
simulators like s51/uCsim (from sdcc) or <a href="http://emu51.sourceforge.net/">emu51</a>,
debuggers like sdcdb (from sdcc),
graphical interfaces (IDE),
working examples, etc. The problem is that the programs designed for the
8051 don't recognize the extensions made by Cypress (USB, I2C, etc.).
</li></ul>

<a name="toc22"></a>
<h2>Other solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>If I'm not able to create my <code>ezusb.lib</code>, look for some other
compiler which accepts libraries in the Keil format.
There are some, but I haven't found any free one which runs on Linux.
It will be difficult to find something better than sdcc.
</li><li>Emulate
<a href="https://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-users/2004/11/0079.html">Keil (with wine)</a>,
or the compiler it uses internally,
<a href="http://www.precma.com/tooltips/crosslinux.htm">C51 (with dosemu)</a>.
It's complicated and the fact that needs a hardware protection (on the
parallel port) makes the job even less pleasant.
</li></ul>

<h2>Disclaimer, and information about this document</h2>
<p>
I started writing this with absolutely no knowledge about microcontrollers;
if in the theory classes at PI they had taught us something about the
practices, I could have gathered all this information faster.
</p>
<p>
I have read things like this
<a href="http://www.8052.com/tut8051.phtml">8051 tutorial</a>,
but I am still a novice on microcontrollers.
With this document I just intend to help a bit
the new students so that they don't start their investigations
from zero.
I recommend to study the source code of the <em>free software</em> projects
(like sdcc); it's a wonderful way of learning
which it's worth profiting.
</p>
<p>
And, by the way, let me say that the subject PI was a general joke
(even when everyone in our school, FIB, knows that). We made the
practices trying things randomly or copying them from somewhere else,
since at our group there were no explanation or notes to take, and the
chip specification (340 pages, in English) didn't help very much at
the beginning.
</p>
<p>
We got to the point where we were reading from a barcode scanner
<em>without</em> having the scanner, and without even knowing how do these
readers work.
A teacher said that we could try to <em>simulate</em> it with Hyperterminal,
but that he could not make it work, so there wasn't very much we could try.
</p>
<p>
And that's the way it was... at the end, the hardest thing to do was not
to pass the subject, but to learn something useful.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and everything I have written has license <q>do what you want</q>,
since I distribute some code which I don't really know if I have the right
to modify.
I have no relation with Cypress or with my university; I am responsible of
everything told here.
Write me if something needs to be changed.
