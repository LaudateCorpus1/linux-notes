<center>The past ten years of my research into hardware security showed 
that any microcontroller, FPGA, secure memory, smartcard, ASIC or custom
 chip can be successfully attacked given enough time and resources. The 
question is whether the semiconductor chip used in a particular 
application can withstand multi-million-dollar attack or would fail to 
defeat a 10-dollar attack. It is relatively easy to choose a chip that 
can withstand very-low-cost attacks. However, would you risk your 
valuable intellectual property inside a chip to a hundred-dollar attack,
 or thousand-dollar attack, or ten-thousand-dollar attack. How to select
 the right chip? How to improve the security of existing chips? The only
 way to answer these questions is by performing security evaluation 
which I have been offering to developers, designers and chip 
manufacturers for many years.</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A lot of microcontrollers are used in modern equipment and
electronic devices. Some of them are used by amateurs to build small
devices for fun, others are used by small companies in control,
measurement or other equipment, others are used for serious
applications by the military, security services, banks, medical
services etc.  Each microcontroller executes the algorithm or program
uploaded into its memory. Usually this algorithm is written in
Assembler (even if you write the program in C it will be translated
into Assembler during compilation); rarely the algorithm is written in
Basic or Java.

</p><p>If you write a program for a microcontroller you are interested in
your work being protected against unauthorized access or copying, so
you want to control distribution of your devices. For this purpose
microcontroller manufacturers developed special features which if
selected allows software authors to prevent people downloading their
program from their microcontroller if activated. This is Copy
protection or Lock feature.  Each microcontroller should be programmed
before using. There are different techniques to do it depend on
manufacturer and type of microcontroller. For evaluation purposes
there are reprogrammable versions of microcontrollers, for production
in small quantities there are one-time programmable (OTP) versions
which is cheaper than reprogrammable one, and for large amount there
are factory programmed versions which are very cheap but you have to
purchase at least 1000 items.  After the program for microcontroller
is written and successfully compiled it should be uploaded into
correspondent microcontroller integrated circuit. For this purpose you
have to use special hardware device called programmer unit. For most
microcontrollers this device could be very simple, cheap and consist
of a power supply adapter, a few transistors, several resistors and a
connector to RS232 or Parallel port. For other microcontrollers you
have to use special programmer units distributed only by
manufacturers, but these microcontrollers are not popular. Of course,
if you want your device to be working properly for years (especially
for OTP versions of microcontrollers) it would be better to use
industrial programmer units which are approved by the most of
manufacturers. You can find all necessary information about this
devices on manufacturers' web-sites in the Internet.

</p><h2>Attack Technologies</h2>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>An increasing number of large and important systems, from pay-TV
through GSM mobile phones and prepayment gas meters to smartcard
electronic wallets, rely to a greater or lesser extent on the tamper
resistance properties of microcontrollers, smartcards and other
special security processors.

</p><p>This tamper resistance is not absolute: an opponent with access to
semiconductor test equipment can retrieve key material from a chip by
direct observation and manipulation of the chip's components. It is
generally believed that, given sufficient investment, any chip-sized
tamper resistant device can be penetrated in this way.

</p><p>So the level of tamper resistance offered by any particular product
can be measured by the time and cost penalty that the protective
mechanisms impose on the attacker. Estimating these penalties is
clearly an important problem, but is one to which security researches,
evaluators and engineers have paid less attention than perhaps it
deserves.

</p><p>We can distinguish four major attack categories:

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Microprobing</b> techniques can be used to access the chip
surface directly, thus we can observe, manipulate, and interfere with
integrated circuit</li>

  <li><b>Software attack</b> use normal communication interface of the
processor and exploit security vulnerabilities found in the protocols,
cryptographic algorithms, or their implementation</li>

  <li><b>Eavesdropping</b> techniques monitor, with high time
resolution, the analog characteristics of all supply and interface
connections and any other electromagnetic radiation by the processor
during normal operation</li>

  <li><b>Fault generation</b> techniques use abnormal environmental
conditions to generate malfunctions in the processor that provide
additional access</li>
</ul>

<p>All microprobing techniques are invasive attacks. They require
hours or weeks in specialized laboratory and in the process they
destroy the packaging. The other three are non-invasive attacks. The
attacked card is not physically harmed during these attacks and the
equipment used in the attack can usually be disguised as a normal
smartcard reader.

</p><p>Non-invasive attacks are particularly dangerous in some
applications for two reasons. Firstly, the owner of the compromised
card might not notice that the secret keys have been stolen, therefore
it is unlikely that the validity of the compromised keys will be
revoked before they are abused. Secondly, non-invasive attacks often
scale well, as the necessary equipment can usually be reproduced and
updated at low cost.

</p><p>The design of most non-invasive attacks requires detailed knowledge
of both the processor and software. On the other hand, invasive
microprobing attacks require very little initial knowledge and usually
work with a similar set of techniques on a wide range of
products. Attacks therefore often start with invasive reverse
engineering, the result of which then help to develop cheaper and
faster non-invasive attacks.

</p><h3>2. Non-Invasive attacks</h3>

<p>The most widely used non-invasive attacks include playing around
supply voltage and clock signal. Under-voltage and over-voltage
attacks could be used to disable protection circuit or force processor
to do wrong operation. For these reasons, some security processors
have voltage detection circuit, but as a rule this circuit does not
react to transients. So fast signals of various kinds may reset the
protection without destroying the protected information.

</p><p>Power and clock transients can also be used in some processors to
affect the decoding and execution of individual instructions. Every
transistor and its connection paths act like an RC element with a
characteristic time delay; the maximum usable clock frequency of a
processor is determined by the maximum delay among its
elements. Similarly, every flip-flop has a characteristic time window
(of a few picoseconds) during which it samples its input voltage and
changes its output accordingly. This window can be anywhere inside the
specified setup cycle of the flip-flop, but is quite fixed for an
individual device at a given voltage and temperature. So if we apply a
clock glitch (a clock pulse much shorter than normal) or a power
glitch (a rapid transient in supply voltage), this will affect only
some transistors in the chip. By varying the parameters, the CPU can
be made to execute a number of completely different wrong
instructions, sometimes including instructions that are not even
supported by the microcode. Although we do not know in advance which
glitch will cause which wrong instruction in which chip, it can be
fairly simple to conduct a systematic search.

</p><p>Another possible way of attack is current analysis. Using 10 - 15
ohm resistor in the power supply, we can measure with an
analog/digital converter the fluctuations in the current consumed by
the card. Preferably, the recording should be made with at least
12-bit resolution and the sampling frequency should be an integer
multiple of the card clock frequency.

</p><p>Drivers on the address and data bus often consist of up to a dozen
parallel inverters per bit, each driving a large capacitive load. They
cause a significant power-supply short circuit during any
transition. Changing a single bus line from 0 to 1 or vice versa can
contribute in the order of 0.5 - 1 mA to the total current at the right
time after the clock edge, such that a 12-bit ADC is sufficient to
estimate the number of bus bits that change at a time. SRAM write
operations often generate the strongest signals. By averaging the
current measurements of many repeated identical transactions, we can
even identify smaller signals that are not transmitted over the
bus. Signals such as carry bit states are of special interest, because
many cryptographic key scheduling algorithms use shift operations that
single out individual key bits in the carry flag. Even if the
status-bit changes cannot be measured directly, they often cause
changes in the instruction sequencer or microcode execution, which
then cause a clear change in the power consumption.

</p><p>The various instructions cause different levels of activity in the
instruction decoder and arithmetic units and can often be quite
clearly distinguished, such that parts of algorithms can be
reconstructed. Various units of the processor have their switching
transients at different times relative to the clock edges and can be
separated in high-frequency measurements.

</p><p>Other possible threat to secure devices is data remanence. This is
the capability of volatile memory to retain information stored in it
for some period of time after power was disconnected. Static RAM
contained the same key for a long period of time could reveal it on
next power on. Other possible way is to 'freeze' state of the memory
cell by applying low temperature to the device. In this case static
RAM could retain information for several minutes at -20ºC or even
hours at lower temperature.

</p><h3>3. Invasive attacks</h3>

<p>Despite to more complexity of invasive attacks some of them could
be done without using expensive laboratory equipment. Low-budget
attackers are likely to get a cheaper solution on the second-hand
market for semiconductor test equipment. With patience and skill it
should not be too difficult to assemble all the required tools for
even under ten thousand US dollars by buying a second-hand microscope
and using self-designed micropositioners. The laser is not essential
for first results, because vibrations in the probing needle can also
be used to break holes into passivation.

</p><p>Invasive attacks start with the removal of the chip
package. Plastic over the chip could be removed by knife. Epoxy resin
around the chip could be removed using fuming nitric acid. Hot fuming
nitric acid dissolves the package without affecting the chip. The
procedure should preferably be carried out under very dry conditions,
as the presence of water could corrode exposed aluminium
interconnects. The chip is then washed with acetone in an ultrasonic
bath, followed optionally by a short bath in deionized water and
isopropanol. After that chip could be glued into a test package and
bonded manually. Having enough experience it might be possible to
remove epoxy without destroying bonding wires and smartcard contacts.

</p><p>Once the chip is opened it is possible to perform probing or
modifying attacks. The most important tool for invasive attacks is a
microprobing workstation. Its major component is a special optical
microscope with a working distance of at least 8 mm between the chip
surface and the objective lens. On a stable platform around a socket
for the test package, we install several micropositioners , which
allow us to move a probe arm with submicrometer precision over a chip
surface. On this arm, we install a probe needle. These elastic probe
hairs allow us to establish electrical contact with on-chip bus lines
without damaging them.

</p><p>On the depackaged chip, the top-layer aluminium interconnect lines
are still covered by a passivation layer (usually silicon oxide or
nitride), which protects the chip from the environment and ion
migration. On top of this, we might also find a polyimide layer that
was not entirely removed by HNO3 but which can be dissolved with
ethylendiamine. We have to remove the passivation layer before the
probes can establish contact. The most convenient depassivation
technique is the use of a laser cutter. The UV or green laser is
mounted on the camera port of the microscope and fires laser pulses
through the microscope onto rectangular areas of the chip with
micrometer precision. Carefully dosed laser flashes remove patches of
the passivation layer. The resulting hole in the passivation layer can
be made so small that only a single bus line is exposed. This prevents
accidental contacts with neighboring lines and the hole also
stabilizes the position of the probe and makes it less sensitive to
vibrations and temperature changes.

</p><p>It is usually not practical to read the information stored on a
security processor directly out of each single memory cell, except for
ROM. The stored data has to be accessed via the memory bus where all
data is available at a single location. Microprobing is used to
observe the entire bus and record the values in memory as they are
accessed.

</p><p>It is difficult to observe all (usually over 20) data and address
bus lines at the same time. Various techniques can be used to get
around this problem. For instance we can repeat the same transaction
many times and use only two to four probes to observe various subsets
of the bus lines. As long as the processor performs the same sequence
of memory accesses each time, we can combine the recorded bus subset
signals into a complete bus trace. Overlapping bus lines in the
various recordings help us to synchronize them before they are
combined.

</p><p>In order to read all memory cells without the help of the card
software, we have to abuse a CPU component as an address counter to
access all memory cells for us. The program counter is already
incremented automatically during every instruction cycle and used to
read the next address, which makes it perfectly suited to serve us as
an address sequence generator. We only have to prevent the processor
from executing jump, call, or return instructions, which would disturb
the program counter in its normal read sequence. Tiny modifications of
the instruction decoder or program counter circuit, which can easily
be performed by opening the right metal interconnect with a laser,
often have the desired effect.

</p><p>Another approach to understand how particular microcontroller or
smartcard work is to reverse engineer it. The first step is to create
a map of a new processor. It could be done by using an optical
microscope with a CCD camera to produce several meter large mosaics of
high-resolution photographs of the chip surface. Basic architecture
structures, such as data and address bus lines, can be identified
quite quickly by studying connectivity patterns and by tracing metal
lines that cross clearly visible module boundaries (ROM, RAM, EEPROM,
ALU, instruction decoder, etc.). All processing modules are usually
connected to the main bus via easily recognizable latches and bus
drivers. The attacker obviously has to be well familiar with CMOS VLSI
design techniques and microcontroller architectures, but the necessary
knowledge is easily available from numerous textbooks.

</p><p>Photographs of the chip surface show the top metal layer, which is
not transparent and therefore obscures the view on many structures
below. Unless the oxide layers have been planarized, lower layers can
still be recognized through the height variations that they cause in
the covering layers. Deeper layers can only be recognized in a second
series of photographs after the metal layers have been stripped off,
which could be achieved by submerging the chip for a few seconds in
hydrofluoric acid (HF) in an ultrasonic bath. HF quickly dissolves the
silicon oxide around the metal tracks and detaches them from the chip
surface. HF is an extremely dangerous substance and safety precautions
have to be followed carefully when handling it.

</p><p>Where the implementation is familiar, there are a number of ways to
extract information from the chip by targeting specific gates or fuses
or by overwriting specific memory locations. Even where this is not
possible, memory cells can be attacked; this can also be done on a
relatively modest budget.

</p><p>Most currently available microcontrollers and smartcard processors
have feature sizes of 0.5 - 1 µm and only two metal layers. These
can be reverse-engineered and observed with the manual and optical
techniques described in the previous sections. For future chip
generations with more metal layers and features below the wavelength
of visible light, more expensive tools additionally might have to be
used.

</p><p>A focused ion beam (FIB) workstation consists of a vacuum chamber
with a particle gun, comparable to a scanning electron microscope
(SEM). Gallium ions are accelerated and focused from a liquid metal
cathode with 30 kV into a beam of down to 5 - 10 nm diameter, with
beam currents ranging from 1 pA to 10 nA. FIBs can image samples from
secondary particles similar to a SEM with down to 5 nm resolution. By
increasing the beam current, chip material can be removed with the
same resolution. Better etch rates can be achieved by injecting a gas
like iodine via a needle that is brought to within a few hundred
micrometers from the beam target. Gas molecules settle down on the
chip surface and react with removed material to form a volatile
compound that can be pumped away and is not redeposited. Using this
gas-assisted etch technique, holes that are up to 12 times deeper than
wide can be created at arbitrary angles to get access to deep metal
layers without damaging nearby structures. By injecting a
platinum-based organometallic gas that is broken down on the chip
surface by the ion beam, platinum can be deposited to establish new
contacts. With other gas chemistries, even insulators can be deposited
to establish surface contacts to deep metal without contacting any
covering layers.

</p><p>Using laser interferometer stages, a FIB operator can navigate
blindly on a chip surface with 0.15 µm precision, even if the
chip has been planarized and has no recognizable surface
structures. Chips can also be polished from the back side down to a
thickness of just a few tens of micrometers. Using laser
interferometer navigation or infrared laser imaging, it is then
possible to locate individual transistors and contact them through the
silicon substrate by FIB editing a suitable hole. This rear-access
technique has probably not yet been used by pirates so far, but the
technique is about to become much more commonly available and
therefore has to be taken into account by designers of new security
chips.  FIBs are used by attackers today primarily to simplify manual
probing of deep metal and polysilicon lines. A hole is drilled to the
signal line of interest, filled with platinum to bring the signal to
the surface, where a several micrometer large probing pad or cross is
created to allow easy access. Modern FIB workstations (for example the
FIB 200xP from FEI) cost less than half a million US$ and are
available in over hundred organizations. Processing time can be rented
from numerous companies all over the world for a few hundred dollars
per hour.

</p><h2>Microcontrollers Overview</h2>

<p>Firstly, let's separate all microcontrollers into two types -
ordinary and secure microcontrollers. Secure microcontrollers are
designed for security applications (the military, banks, medical
service etc.) and used in Smartcards or security modules. They provide
different modes of operation, different access levels, encryption of
data communication not only outside the chip but also inside it by
using bus encryption, signals hiding etc. Attacks on this
microcontrollers require very sophisticated and expensive equipment,
very high skill of knowledge and should be discussed separately.
Ordinary microcontrollers as a rule also have security protection
against reading out the program and/or data (in case of
microcontrollers with Data memory) but developers should be aware that
sometimes this protection is very weak. Before discussing possible
ways of attacks on ordinary microcontrollers it would be better to
divide them into different classes by type of memory. Next table shows
differences between microcontrollers with different type of program
memory and also advantages and disadvantages of each type.

</p><p>There are two ways of attacks on microcontrollers - invasive and
non-invasive. The first one involves depackaging of the chip followed
by exposing certain part of the chip to laser or ion beam, or/and
probing under microscope on probing station. Non-invasive attacks
include playing around the signals applied to the chip to obtain all
necessary information.

</p><p>If microcontroller has a <b>Mask ROM</b> then as a rule any access
is denied by the manufacturer at the stage of production. Meanwhile
there might be the way to overcome it if there is some kind of test
monitor program on the chip to test the Mask ROM after
production. Generally it is very difficult to find it and the fastest
way to extract the program is to depackage the chip and read out
memory contents optically.  Sometimes to increase security
manufacturers use transistors with different threshold voltage instead
of using presence or absence of a transistor to create cells with 0's
and 1's. This kind of ROM cannot be read optically. In this case memory
contents could be read using microprobing techniques or using
selective chemical etching.

</p><p>If microcontroller has an <b>OTP ROM</b> then end-user can select
code protection facility during programming. If it was enabled then it
is still possible to apply both invasive and non-invasive
attacks. Invasive attacks as a rule include exposing certain part of
the chip into Ultra-Violet light, cutting lock lines by laser or
restoring security fuses on probing station. Non-Invasive attacks
include applying different signals to make internal protection scheme
"forget" about protection.

</p><p>In case of microcontrollers with <b>UV EPROM</b> situation is the same as
with OTP ones, because usually they have absolutely the same structure
and difference is only in their package.

</p><p>If microcontroller has an <b>EEPROM</b> memory it is more stable
for invasive attacks, because it is very difficult to handle with
electrical charge rather than with transistors. Although the same
attacks as for OTP microcontrollers could be applied. It is still
possible to probe bus lines inside the chip but it requires high skill
of attacker. In the same time, non-invasive attacks could be applied
very easily. It takes place because EEPROM cell has very specific
behavior and very sensible to control signals and to timings of the
control signals. That allows the attacker to find ways of overcoming
security protection either by selective erasing of the security fuses
or by causing the security control scheme get wrong state of the
security fuses.

</p><p>Situation with <b>Flash EPROM</b> microcontrollers practically the
same as with EEPROM microcontrollers. Sometimes their security could
be easily broken, sometimes harder but the situation still bad. So,
there are ways to break the security in almost any Flash and EEPROM
microcontroller.

</p><p>Recently introduced <b>FRAM</b> microcontrollers seems to be more
secure due to specific structure of the memory. Although it is still
possible to apply microprobing in order to obtain contents of the
memory.

</p><p>Microcontrollers with <b>SRAM</b> quite stable to invasive attacks
because any tampering into the device will cause disconnection of the
power supply from SRAM with following vanishing of the
information. But due to some bugs in hardware and software
implementation there is possibility to apply non-invasive attacks on
such microcontrollers.  For example, secure microcontroller chip
DS5002FP from the Dallas Semiconductor is one of the processors for
which a way to bypass the security bit was found. You can find
explanation of this attack in the next paper:

<br>Markus G. Kuhn: Cipher Instruction Search Attack on the
Bus-Encryption Security Microcontroller DS5002FP. IEEE
Transactions on Computers, Vol. 47, No. 10, October 1998,
pp. 1153-1157.

</p><p>The most serious threat for microcontrollers with security
protection is non-invasive attacks, because in general they are
cheaper than invasive. If you can write your own program or legally
buy preprogrammed version of microcontroller you will find it cheaper
than doing invasive attacks. Meantime, some kind of invasive attacks
might be reasonably cheap. For example, if the security bits are
vulnerable to UV light. So, designing something using microcontroller
you have to assess your work and choose microcontroller with
appropriate protection. It is not possible to get perfect protection
but you can make hacking of your device to be useless due to high
price of attack.

</p><h2>Non-Invasive Attacks on Microcontrollers</h2>

<p>I have been investigating into copy protection mechanisms in
different microcontrollers since 1996. PIC16F84 was one of the first
microcontrollers I have unprotected. Occasionally I do some research in
this area and provide testing of new microcontrollers and renew
testing of old.

</p><p>Now let me introduce what sort of equipment I have been using for
non-invasive attacks on microcontrollers. I built my own designed
programmer device controlled by my software program. It operates on
IBM PC under MS-DOS or Windows 95/98 and it was written in
C++. Hardware of my programmer allows me to rapidly change power
supply and programming voltages in wide range causing different power
glitches. This is quite essential if you provide attacks on
microcontrollers. Signal block of the programmer generates 32 output
digital signals with adjustable logic levels and some of them has
open-drain output. Also this block inputs 16 signals at correct logic
levels. This is quite enough for most of microcontrollers. Another
part of the programmer is the board with different IC sockets for most
of microcontrollers I have tested. For some microcontrollers I use
additional socket adapters.

</p><p>Here is some pictures of my device.

</p><p>For some microcontrollers I know a few methods to overcome
protection. Some of them give very reliable results, another has less
than 20% of success (these methods sometimes appear in the Internet
and, moreover, using these methods you could not only burn the chip
but programmer unit too).

</p><h2>Invasive Attacks on Microcontrollers</h2>

<h4>WARNING! I do not carry any responsibility for using further
information in order to break your microcontroller. It is only brief
short explanation of my experiments. If you are trying to repeat this
work you are doing it on your own risk!</h4>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>It is commonly believed that invasive attacks are very complicated
and require a lot of sophisticated equipment. It is not the case. Of
course invasive attacks should cost more than non-invasive because
involve depackaging of the chip and applying different physical
methods. But sometimes they could be done quite easily without using
expensive laboratory equipment. It reveals a huge threat to a device
based on microcontroller which was assumed to be strong to
non-invasive attacks but nothing related with invasive attacks was
evaluated.

</p><p>Let me break the myth which says that the minimum cost of invasive
attack is ten thousand US$, therefore if microcontroller you use is
not vulnerable to non-invasive attack you have proper protection
against copying of your code. The aim is to make developers to be
aware that proper evaluation should be performed before using certain
microcontroller.

</p><p>Let me show how PIC12C508A device could be broken and then you can
estimate how difficult it is and how much could it cost. Then I will
introduce an attack on PIC16F874 which requires more equipment but
could be done using only microscope with probing needle.

</p><h3>2. Attack on PIC12C508A</h3>

<p>Firstly we have to depackage the chip. It could be done in two
ways: dissolving everything around the chip or removing plastic only
above the silicon die. The last one is more intelligent but requires
some level of knowledge and experience, while the first way will force
you to bond the chip on a test package and it is not possible to carry
out it without having access to a bonding station.

</p><p>So the only convenient way for us is to remove plastic above the
chip die. It is possible to do this using fuming nitric acid which
dissolves epoxy plastic (material of the package) without affecting
the chip and bonding wires. Exhausted acid should be removed by an
acetone followed by cleaning the sample in an ultrasonic bath, wash in
water to remove remain salts and drying. If you do not have an
ultrasonic bath you can skip this operation. In this case the chip
surface will remain slightly dirty but it still be transparent to UV
light. Meanwhile the ultrasonic bath could be easily built using
simple frequency generator connected to ferrite antenna coil and
appropriate metal dish for bath.

</p><p>Here is some pictures of this process.

</p><p><img src="Breaking%20copy%20protection%20in%20microcontrollers_files/pic12c508a.jpg" alt="Picture of

</p><p>Next stage is to expose protection fuses to UV light. In order to
do this you have to find where they are. If you have a microscope with
at least 100x magnification you can easily find them just tracing the
wire from the pin for programming voltage input. If you do not have a
microscope you can do simple search exposing different part of the
chip to UV light and observing the result. Once you have found them
you can apply it to protected chip. You should use opaque paper in
order to protect Program memory from UV light. Five to ten minutes
under UV light should give you proper result and you would be able to
read Program memory using any available programmer unit.

</p><p>Another possible attack requires additional equipment like
microscope and laser cutter/thin needle. Once you have found
protection fuse you can find all signal lines coming to this part of
circuit. Due to design mistake it is possible to disable copy
protection just by cutting one line from protection fuse to rest of
the circuit. For unknown reason this line is sufficiently far away
from other lines. That makes possible to cut this line not only using
expensive laser cutter but also scratching surface above this line by
a needle until the wire will be cut.

</p><h3>3. Attack on PIC16F874</h3> First stage - depackaging is
absolutely the same as for PIC12C508A.

<p>Because this chip uses shielded EEPROM cells for protection it is
not possible to reset protection using a UV light. So we should try to
use microprobing technique in order to read the memory contents. Once
you have depackaged the chip you should look onto it under a
microscope. You can easily find data lines going from memory array to
rest of the circuit. For unknown reason copy protection doesn't lock
access to the memory in programming mode so if you put probing needle
on top of the data line you will see all necessary data. Restarting
read operation in programming mode and connecting probing needle to
different data lines you can read all the information from both
Program and Data memories.

</p><h2>Threat of Attack and Defense Technologies</h2>

<p>Now having information about different attack methods we can divide
these attacks by threat to device based on microcontroller.

</p><p><b>Non-invasive attacks</b> introduce very high level of threat
therefore if microcontroller is vulnerable to such attacks it has
minimum level of protection. The only equipment which attacker should
have is a special programmer unit. For example, you can find such
programmer units for PIC16C84 widely available for sale in the
Internet for quite reasonable price.

</p><p><b>Cheap invasive attacks</b> also reveal big problem to
designers. These attacks could be implemented by practically any
person familiar with school chemistry course. All necessary equipment
could be bought for 100 to 300 US$. And microcontrollers vulnerable to
such attacks could not be enough secure.

</p><p>Such <b>invasive attacks as microprobing</b> could be used only by
well funded attackers. It makes microcontrollers vulnerable only to
these attacks to be enough secured. But also, if you calculate price
of equipment and time to break one microcontroller you will get price
of attack not exceeding one thousand US$. So you cannot use such
microcontrollers in expensive project where protection is the
necessary requirement.

</p><p><b>Reverse engineering</b> is the most expensive invasive attack
could be used. It gives all the necessary information about chip
schematics and structure of protection circuit. But it takes long time
and require very expensive equipment. So if microcontroller could not
be broken by any of above mentioned attacks it should be good
secured. Although maybe it was not broken due to mistake of attacker
and other attacker could break it quite easily.

</p><p>Now we get very awful situation where practically any standard
microcontroller could be broken using one of the first three attack
methods. Usually it is not possible to redesign project for secure
microcontroller which can withstand practically any attack because of
high price of such microcontrollers and incompatibility with ordinary
microcontrollers. Usually secure microcontrollers are designed for
smartcard applications where used only two pins for serial digital
interface. Of course, you can use secure microcontroller to protect
the project but if attacker interested only in certain part of the
algorithm implemented in normal microcontroller he can extract it
without a problem.

</p><p>Another approach is to use hardware protection based on a
programmable logic array (PAL, CPLD, EPLD) which usually has better
protection and even if you break it you will spend a lot of time to
understand how it works.

</p><p>But why not to use undocumented features of the same
microcontroller. If you are using OTP, UV EPROM, EEPROM or Flash
microcontroller it is possible to use certain cells of its memory for
protection. The idea behind this is the next. All these memories are
analog memory, so each cell inside the array keeps charge instead of
logic state. When memory cell is read this charge is translated into a
logic signal by sense amplifier. If you charge cell to intermediate
state corresponds to threshold value of sense amplifier then because
of presence of a noise you will read different value from the same
cell. This feature could be used as additional protection to ordinary
security feature of a microcontroller.

</p><p>Another possible way of increasing protection is to destroy
possibility of further programming. It could be done mechanically by
cutting certain pins or electrically by applying high voltage to these
pins to blow up bonding wire. Although it does not provide any
protection against invasive attacks.

</p><p>More intelligent way is to destroy certain part of the control
circuit dedicated for programming mode. Although in order to do such a
thing you should reverse engineer certain part of the chip or apply
microprobing technique to learn how it works. But sometimes it might
cost more than the value of your project.

</p><h2>Further Research</h2>

<p>The other interesting way of research is evaluation of the security
in Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA) and Programmable Logic Devices
(PLD). They also have security protection feature but it was not
tested by the same methods like microcontrollers. Sometimes this
devices are used for complex projects in parallel to FPGA chips but
only to prevent unauthorised copying because FPGA chip does not have
any protection facility due to external loading of configuration. In
this case attacks on EEPROMed PLA/PLD also could be serious threat for
such devices.

</p><p>Currently I am trying to sum up the results, make another
experiments and prepare the article.

</p><p>If you are interested in your sample chips to be tested and
evaluated we could discuss possible ways of collaboration. Beforehand
I want to mention that I am not a commercial company specializing in
breaking security in microcontrollers. I am just providing research
work and consulting.

</p><p>The details of my research into microcontrollers security and all
the results are confidential until they will be published or disclosed
in my PhD thesis. Usually I provide some information and doing
specific research only for companies who supports my research or gives
me necessary equipment to continue my research into hardware
security. It could be done as a sponsoring, giving certain grant or as
a consulting.

</p><p>I've spent a huge amount of time and correspondently money doing
such research and as I want to publish it in the future I'll keep it
under the secret. At the same time I am opened to any possible
contract for building special programmer for testing purposes without
sharing all the information.

</p><p>I always reply to personal emails. But sometimes due to server
problems mail could be losted. Therefore please resend me your message
if I have not replied within one week. In case of important messages I
would prefer you to forward copy of your letter to my Hushmail
account.
