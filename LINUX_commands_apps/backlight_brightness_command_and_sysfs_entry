######## FIXED!!! FIXES LISTED BELOW ####################
KeyBoard BackLight add "acpi_osi=" to end of boot command
LCD BackLight add "acpi_backlight=none" to boot command

echo 937 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness                (937 was the highest number it would except)

if the current option in /etc/default/grub doesnt work (video.use_native_backlight=1) then try;
acpi_backlight=none      (the /sys/class/backlight/acpi0 doesnt effect anything so this should force intel_backlight)

also theres an xorg option to try if that doesnt work;

/etc/X11/xorg.conf
