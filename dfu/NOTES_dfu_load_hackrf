To start up HackRF One in DFU mode, hold down the DFU button while powering it
on or while pressing and releasing the RESET button.  Release the DFU button
after the 3V3 LED illuminates.

A .dfu file is built by default when building firmware.  Alternatively you can
use a known good .dfu file from a release package.  Load the firmware into RAM
with:

$ dfu-util --device 1fc9:000c --alt 0 --download hackrf_usb.dfu
