What happens in an ubuntu session is -
After logging in, no display. If the session is left inactive until display is put to sleep, then awakining it thru keyboard or mouse brings back a visible display. (default is 5 min. of inactivity

A simple startup script via startup applications demonstrates -
script in ~/bin

#!/bin/bash
xset dpms force off
xset dpms force on

~/.config/autostart/unblank.desktop

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=unblank1
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Name=unblank
X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=3

So with above in place after the blind login > 3 secs > visible display is returned

It's been suggested that xorg.conf needs some serverflags, ie.

Section "ServerFlags"
        Option "BlankTime" "0"
        Option "OffTime" "0"
EndSection

Though not effective here as a standalone section & if there is an xorg.conf solution then it needs to be patched into ubuntu-drivers-common

Demonstration 2
If the autostart script was in place then disable

Alter the sleep time of unity-greeter from 300 to 6 (sec) in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.unity-greeter.gschema.xml
(at bottom of file, assumes 6 sec is enough time to enter password, if not increase 6 to something suitable

sudo -H gedit /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.unity-greeter.gschema.xml

recompile schemas
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

Log out or restart, at black greeter screen wait at least 6 sec., then press a key. (or wait for value set above in the .xml
The greeter screen will become visible - Quickly enter password & press enter while the screen is still visible

Login session will have a visible display as expected
